A women in her late 20s, she is slightly reserved in the English manner, but with a quick laugh. She describes herself as an ''Evaluator in the fixed income department of a large information services company'' and earns £70,000 per year.</em></p><p>"At dinner parties and other social events it tends to be men who want to know what my job entails. It may be because these men work in finance themselves, or that they have investments. I think it''s a shame that there are not more women interested in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bonds" title="Guardian: Bonds">bonds</a>; they are a very good investment, and not just for cautious people. I wish more women took an interest in finance – knowledge is an extremely important part of being financially independent.</p><p>"The biggest misunderstanding about my job? I don''t know if many outsiders know it even exists; I often have to explain it.</p><p>"In a nutshell what my company does is provide an independent valuation of a fixed income asset – loans [bonds] that pay a fixed interest. We are independent, meaning we do not hold or trade any of these assets ourselves.</p><p>"Companies and governments need money. So they borrow it from investors like pension funds, insurers and other institutions with money entrusted to them and effectively write an ''I owe you'' in return. You will read about these things in the news, for instance, when <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jul/14/investors-italian-bonds-austerity-budget" title="Guardian: Bond investors give Italy warning shot">Italy holds an auction to sell government bonds</a> – this is called the primary market.</p><p>"Imagine that at the Italian government auction you bought a so-called ''10-year bond''. This means the Italian government promises to repay your investment in 10 years, and to give you a certain yearly percentage – the interest, or ''coupon payment''. The greater an investment risk that government is deemed to be, the higher the interest payment.</p><p>"Now, suppose that the next week you read that the Italian government is in trouble. What if the Italian government is going to default on its debt, meaning that it cannot repay your investment? You worry you are at risk of losing most of your money. Then you would want to sell your bond, right? So you go to the secondary market. There, supply meets demand for all sorts of bonds, both government and corporate.</p><p>"What determines the price for your Italian bond? There are all sorts of variables driving that, from individual credit risk, for example, if unemployment rose in Italy during the last financial quarter, to volatile market events such as when Lehman Brothers collapsed. My job is to keep track of those and provide an independent evaluation of the value of these assets; often a regulatory requirement for those who own the bonds.</p><p>"Your 10-year Italian bond is traded a lot, because government bonds are what we call ''liquid'' – at most times there will be a considerable number of buyers and sellers, meaning that you have an actual running market. There are also bonds in companies or governments that are traded much less on the secondary market. And some bonds are simply ''held to maturity'', where somebody bought them and sat out the 10 years, collecting interest and then getting repaid at the end.</p><p>"Now, pension funds and other investors own all these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity" title="Wikipedia: Market liquidity">illiquid bonds</a> or ''have them on their books''. They want to know what they are worth, in fact, regulation forces them to keep track. Those illiquid bonds may not have been traded for days or weeks. My company determines their value based on analysis of more liquid assets and the market they trade in currently. Then we apply that analysis and knowledge of credit risks, interest rates etcetera, to provide an evaluated level for that illiquid asset if it were to trade in the current market. We have thousands of clients holding thousands of these assets, paying for an evaluation of each, that is how my department makes its money.</p><p>"We may get challenged for our evaluation, and then you have to go back to your market sources and other information and stand up for your decision or revise it. For example, we may set a value at 55, then get an email from a client that this bond traded at 57 yesterday, and we have to look at that trade, contact the trader themselves, determine what has happened since then in that market and for that bond issuer and so on.</p><p>"I get into work around 9am. I will have checked my email by then, and I go through all my sources of info. The news, specialised websites, special news services, I try to take in as much as I can. When I get to work, the markets in Asia will have been open for hours, so I have to play catch-up and that continues all through the day. What are the bond markets doing, are there bond auctions, important press conferences? I review what''s happening in the world and how this may affect bonds traded in the market.</p><p>"My company files an update on the value of thousands of bonds, every night. So from four o''clock onwards we''re running <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/" title="Bank of England: Yield curves">yield curves</a>, checking and rechecking our evaluation of these bonds'' value, against other information, against certain trades, internal quality checks and checks against other information providers who also value these assets.</p><p>"I usually get out between 7 and 8pm, depending on the market. In August most of Europe is on holiday so usually it''s really quiet. This year it was crazy with the European debt crisis. It can be a fascinating job: observe what streams of money flow where, see the market respond to rumours. Essentially, everything is interesting if you see it at a high enough level.</p><p>"It''s also a balancing act, given how busy things can get. I go swimming to relax, and when I am really stressed I lift weights. I am not at all competitive by nature, and feel no need for team sports. When the markets get really rocky, for instance, at the peak of the crisis in 2008, even time for exercise may not be there.</p><p>"My job is male-dominated and this has made me develop a thicker skin than I might have otherwise. The office banter can be pretty sharp, and you must learn not to take anything personal. I can handle the shouting, the outbursts and the jokes; I enjoy the jokes – maybe because I grew up with brothers and went to a traditional university with male-dominated economics classes. On our floor there can be banter about the likelihood of you dying alone, or the reasons you are single. There are less likely to be jokes about my weight, or about men''s hair loss. You just know when somebody has gone too far. When the markets are volatile, the stress carries over to the work floor and people need to blow off steam. Don''t take it personal and tell them to eff off, that''s the drill.</p><p>"I have learned useful things in a male-dominated environment; the value of compartmentalisation. Women will often encourage you to have a conversation about whatever it is that''s bothering you, but it can be good to not ask about that, to separate the personal entirely from the professional.</p><p>"With my friends who work outside finance, I don''t sense envy or tension. I have heard from female colleagues whose dates expected them to pick up the tab, fortunately that never happened to me! I might bring a bottle of champagne rather than wine to a dinner party, to buy off my guilt that I am late, or completely knackered, or that I need to talk about my work for the first 30 minutes.</p><p>"I don''t think my working in finance affected – as you so finely put it – my chances on the ''meat market''. However, I have dated men mainly outside of finance, so no pattern of difference there.</p><p>"I have been in this role for a little under 10 years now and I love what I do. It''s analytical, you learn to sift through vast amounts of information, to prioritise, react to pressure. The downside is the stress involved in volatile times. I don''t make the kinds of amounts that some seem to think people in finance make. I consider myself lucky, there are a lot of people in the financial sector, mainly those in the back offices, who make considerably less while also having much less job security. These are the people who bear the brunt when banks have to cut costs – either because the banks messed up or because the economy took a hit.</p><p>"I could be making more money, possibly at a big bank, but am deliberately at this kind of company. I feel no urge to be at a desk at 6.30 in the morning, in a black suit. At this firm there''s no way that colleagues would take shorter maternity leave because they''re worried about their jobs."</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Bonds&k=UK+news&k=Financial+sector&k=Business" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Voices+of+finance%3A+bond+pricer+%7C+Joris+Luyendijk+Article+1647331&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=60753&c4=Bonds+%28Business%29%2CUK+news%2CFinancial+sector+%28business%29%2CBusiness&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Joris+Luyendijk&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1647331&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2011/oct/16/voices-of-finance-bond-pricer|2011-10-16T21:13:13+01:00|d04f2d6bac9a2aa4d395b1ce863ac5181d22731e -->', NULL, 'Comment is free', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:16');

You can borrow traits from real life, but the best characters are born of a deeper human understanding, writes <strong>Andrew Miller</strong></p>', '<p>First, a note of caution. To slice up fiction into categories such as "plot", "voice", "point of view" or "character" is to risk presenting it in a way that neither writer nor reader normally experiences it. The suggestion might seem to be that the writing of a story or a novel is a strongly segmented or layered activity, something orderly, dry and technical. But stories, when they come, come in organic gobs, as though gouged out of the living fabric of world – character tangled with plot, plot with setting, setting with scraps of language embedded and so on. But laying that aside, that large proviso, there are a few remarks that might be usefully attempted under the heading of "character".</p><p>First off (and at the risk of being punched in the face by some follower of the <em>nouveau roman</em> school), let it be loudly asserted that character, strong characters, are at the heart of all great literature and always will be. Plot, even in detective fiction, is a very secondary matter. Not many readers could outline the plot of The Sign of the Four but no one has any difficulty bringing Holmes and Watson to mind.</p><p>A writer who does not create convincing characters will fail. A&nbsp;writer who creates thrilling, troubling, seductive, insistent characters need not worry too much about any other aspect of writing. You do not need to know how to spell. You do not need to know much about grammar. You do not even need any huge sensitivity to language, though this is the other quality that really matters in writing; it&nbsp;is also, perhaps, the most resistant to&nbsp;any kind of formal&nbsp;teaching.</p><p>So having insisted so immoderately on the central importance of character, how in God''s name is it done? Luckily, the raw material is close to hand. For every writer, it is his own enigmatic being that constitutes the focus of his research. Year after year, he sits on a kind of umpire''s chair watching the antics of his body, listening to the bubbling of his thoughts, sifting the material of his dreams. And when he wants more – other bodies, other thoughts – he simply looks up at those around him.</p><p>Think, for a moment, of your own family. Almost everybody has one. You might never need to go beyond them. You could keep them all in a kind of mental aquarium, sketching them into stories all your writing life. Change their names, of course, their hair colour, their tattoos; move them from that little town in the south you grew up in to a&nbsp;little town in the north you once drove through and wondered about …</p><p>But a writer is not confined to such a&nbsp;tactic. It may even be that such a tactic is not particularly common. In my own work I have very rarely set out to present a character who is knowingly based on someone familiar to me, someone whose name I might find in my address book. The great majority of&nbsp;my characters – and I would guess this is true for most writers of fiction – are "inventions". They emerge, quickly or slowly, shyly or boisterously, in the writing. They are members of that shifting population of men, women and children (not to mention cats, horses, etc) who inhabit our inner worlds. Where they come from, whether they are curious versions of ourselves, figures out of the collective unconscious, reconfigurings of those we did indeed once know but have now&nbsp;forgotten, or a mix of all such, no one, to&nbsp;my knowledge, has ever convincingly answered.</p><p>It does not matter. No one writes for long without understanding that they are entering mystery and will never leave it. What matters is that we can, through unnamed processes, secrete these figures who will loom and mouth off in our fictions. It is not, I think, too much to say that it is a "natural" process, that we are, all of us, geared up for it, and that without this propensity, writing would be impossibly complex. We could not do it.</p><p>There is, of course, another great reservoir of characters: those ready-made for us in books. It is not that we intend to steal Mr Tulkinghorn from Dickens or Ursula Brangwen from Lawrence, but that such characters show us the dimensions of the possible. A painter who wants to paint a tree needs to do two things: look at trees and look at paintings of trees. The first task shows what trees are like, the second shows the possibilities of the medium. Likewise, as a writer, it is by reading that you learn how, in language, a character can be presented – through dialogue, through action, through physical attributes, interior monologue etc – a&nbsp;process that continues until you have absorbed these methods, and they have become a reflex so embedded in your apprehending of the world that you will never notice anything about anybody without secretly assessing its potential for fiction writing. And this, indeed, we could call "technique", though we should not confuse the method with the task.</p><p>At its simplest, its barest, characterisation is about a writer''s grasp of what a human being is. When we set out to write, we do not do so out of a&nbsp;sense of certainty but out of a kind of radical uncertainty. We do not set out saying: "The world is like this." But asking: "How is the world?" In creating characters we are posing to ourselves large, honest questions about our nature and the nature of those about us. Our answers are the characters themselves, those talking spirits we conjure up by a kind of organised dreaming. And when we finish, we are immediately dissatisfied with them, these "answers", and we set out again, bemused, frustrated, excited. An odd use of time! An odd use of a life.

While Vettel was untroubled at the front all the action was behind him where Lewis Hamilton, who had started on pole, drove an exceptional race to secure second place, his first podium since winning the German Grand Prix in July. Mark Webber''s third place provided the final points Red Bull needed and he was followed home by Jenson Button in fourth.</p><p>McLaren had shown pace in the one dry practice session to take pole in qualifying, breaking Red Bull''s dominance of the top spot. But with so little running on slicks, race pace had been difficult to assess, however within a lap it became clear that normal service, in the form of Vettel pulling away at the front, was to resume.</p><p>There were spots of rain before the off, causing some concern but the downpour that engulfed last year''s race did not arrive and the track remained dry, which allowed a clean start for the short run down to turn one. Hamilton made it first but Vettel powered up to him down the longest straight in F1 – the 1,160 metres between turns two and three. By its end he was under the British driver''s rear wing, stayed there and, Hamilton having moved across once already had to leave room, which Vettel gleefully took, throwing his car up the inside of the hairpin at turn four.</p><p>This gave the world champion the clear air he has enjoyed so often this year and with concerns over early tyre degradation proving unfounded only raw speed could catch him. Hamilton gave it his best for the first 10 laps while suffering with understeer, staying within two-and-a-half seconds but never reducing the lead to under a second, which might have given him a chance with the DRS deployed.</p><p>Button, who had started in third, had a poor opening lap, dropping places to Webber, Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso. Then, after a wheel-to-wheel exit of the pit lane with Nico Rosberg, in which he had to lift as the pair funnelled towards the track, he took the place back going inside him into turn two as the German went wide, was promptly retaken by Rosberg under DRS immediately afterwards on the back straight before Button finally finished the job on the Mercedes a lap later, again, on the back straight. After which furious competition the stop paid off for both drivers, coming in early and taking the undercut to pass both Massa and Alonso.</p><p>A safety car period caused when Vitaly Petrov launched itself up the back of Michael Schumacher''s Mercedes at turn three, the German delayed by a slow Sauber in front and Petrov coming in too hot, settled the race order as: Vettel, Hamilton, Webber, Button, Rosberg, Massa and Alonso. For the top four that is how it would remain.</p><p>As Vettel slowly pulled out a lead after a clean restart, Hamilton found himself having to defend from a clearly faster Webber the pair going wheel-to-wheel through the tight section between turns three and six before and continuing all the way to turn 11 before Hamilton held the spot. He would do so until the end with Webber rarely more than 0.4 seconds behind him and indeed taking the place at the second corner only to see it retaken by Hamilton on the back straight, with only five laps to go.</p><p>Alonso had by now passed Massa and the pair both passed Rosberg but despite a late charge the Spaniard could only come close to catching Button. They finished fifth and sixth with a fine run by Jaime Alguersuari pipping Rosberg to seventh.</p><p>The day belonged to Vettel and Red Bull but the race was Hamilton''s. He drove magnificently to keep a clearly faster car behind him but it was not the win he craves and his reaction afterwards was as subdued as it had been after qualifying but his talent won out and to be back on the podium at least, after a difficult season, will feel like a step in the right direction.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=Formula+One+2011&k=Formula+One&k=Sebastian+Vettel&k=Motor+sport&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Sebastian+Vettel+wins+10th+grand+prix+of+F1+season+in+Korea+Article+1648307&ch=Sport&c2=60753&c4=Formula+One+2011%2CFormula+One%2CSebastian+Vettel%2CMotor+sport%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Giles+Richards+in+Yeongam&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648307&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2011/oct/16/sebastian-vettel-f1-korean-grandprix|2011-10-16T21:13:13+01:00|9cbc4dee6c03ef0dda8f72b477a5e51b93495ea1 -->', NULL, 'Sport', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:16'),

We spoke shortly before Saturday''s gathering in Málaga''s main Plaza de la Constitución – the last major 15M protest there, in June, before the holidays, saw 25,000 people occupy the square.</p><p>The nationwide movement, which grew out of the Madrid 15 May protest, is avowedly local and non-hierarchical, and I was intrigued by how this actually functioned. Besides its over-arching, general demands – truly participative democracy, an end to corruption, a tax on financial transactions, a government that works for the good of all rather than the profit of a few – how does 15M actually work on the ground?</p><p>Rocio said that in Málaga, neighbourhood committees met locally at least once a week across the city, discussing strictly neighbourhood issues. Each could be attended by up to several dozen people, she said. And in Constitutión Square, gatherings were held most weekday evenings.</p><p>These are either twice-weekly citizens'' assemblies for all, typically drawing around 100 people, or smaller meetings of 15M''s city-wide special commissions, which hammer out – among other things – its stance on communication and media, culture, education, ecology, immigration, equality, labour, health, university, housing and action.</p><p>"It''s very hard, I have to say," Rocio said. "There''s a lot of talking, and a lot of voting. We vote all the time, on everything. It takes a lot of time. But it''s essential, if we are to demonstrate that the way politics is run at the moment isn''t the right way."</p><p>In Spain, she said, the existing system had failed because "so many politicians are really only interested in filling their pockets, and staying in power. They specialise in the kind of vanity politics, big empty gestures, that they think will help get them re-elected," she added.</p><p>15M Málaga''s demands to the city council include: an immediate end to evictions; proper care of the city''s squares, parks and gardens; better road cleaning and more recycling bins; improved public transport; investment in education at all levels; closer co-operation with neighbourhood associations on grievances; the promotion of ethical banks and credit unions.</p><p>"It''s about demanding that the city authorities do what they are supposed to do," she said. "Spend money wisely, for the good of all the people, make sure their citizens have what they really need, not sidewalks made of marble like they have in Marbella. It''s about really looking after people, doing a proper job – the complete opposite of what so much politics is actually about right now, in fact. I mean, why don''t we have cycle paths in Málaga? Why don''t we have trains and buses that run later into the evening? It''s just common sense, really."</p><p>Rocio, who works on a local tourism publication, is optimistic, she said, "because I have to be, but also because I see how bad this crisis really is. There have been crises in Spain before, in 1982, 1990, but nothing like this. Here, in Málaga, unemployment is climbing every month – 6,000 more people this month – and we have families going hungry. In Spain, in the 21st century! It''s just so wrong."</p><p>And she''s confident too, she said, because "the politicians are going to have to take notice of us. We really have a base, now. All ages, all sections of society. The first 15M Málaga assembly I went to, there were pensioners, students, shopkeepers – elderly women of 80! It brought me out in goosebumps, it was so marvellous. They''ll have to sit up and listen."</p><p>• If you have a story to tell, know a person I should talk to or live in a place you think I should visit, please contact me: jon.henley@guardian.co.uk, or @jonhenley (the hashtag for this venture is #EuroDebtTales)</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Spain&k=European+debt+crisis&k=Europe&k=World+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Europe+on+the+breadline%3A+Spanish+activists+show+how+politics+could+be+run+Article+1648308&ch=World+news&c2=60753&c4=Spain+%28News%29%2CEuropean+debt+crisis%2CEurope%2CWorld+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jon+Henley&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648308&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/blog/2011/oct/16/spanish-citizens-demonstrate-politics|2011-10-16T21:13:13+01:00|9760ea37d29fcd9e28d772fb9e9b495abdf5a750 -->', NULL, 'World news', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:16'),

Such a hit on the former Kiwi was not considered much of a crime.</p><p>The game could not have started more sweetly for those who would taunt Cooper in these parts. The fly-half over-hit the kick-off, straight into touch. It allowed the All Blacks to set up camp, following the scrum, in the Australian 22. The waves of attacks came, wide and narrow, and the strain told.

It was even worse when his opposite number, little Aaron Cruden, calmly slotted a drop goal.</p><p>Will Genia threaded a kick along the ground that hit Kahui.

Territory took over as the prize and Australia found themselves pinned way back. The All Blacks turned up the heat at the tackle and contested furiously.</p><p>Weepu left, came back on for Andy Ellis, who left covered in blood, kicked a final penalty and then left again.

Later he said: "I think you will find that contacts with other ministers apart from Liam Fox with Mr Werritty would be very slight."</p><p>Hague said he had only been a "name on the letterhead" for the Atlantic Bridge thinktank set up by Fox. "It doesn''t mean that you know how the thing is being run in detail," he said.</p><p>On <a href="http://news.sky.com/home/" title="">Sky''s</a> Murnaghan programme, Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, said : "I''m quite sure the prime minister and cabinet secretary will be looking to see if there are any lessons which need to be learned as a result of what has happened."</p><p>David Cameron was committed to "cleaning up politics", Mitchell said. He added: "It is right that government should be as open and transparent as possible and is practical."</p><p><a href="http://www.johnmannmp.com/" title="">Labour MP John Mann</a> wants City of London police to investigate whether Werritty had committed a crime by calling himself Fox''s adviser. He also plans to ask the police and <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/" title="">Electoral Commission</a> to look at whether Fox, who resigned on Friday, should face criminal proceedings.</p><p>"I referred the matter to the police to investigate whether there is a potential fraud", Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, told <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" title="">the Sunday Telegraph</a>. "Mr Werritty gave out business cards saying he was an adviser to Dr Fox. If that is not the case and he was getting money – for whatever purpose – by misrepresenting his relationship with the defence secretary, that cannot be right."</p><p>City of London police confirmed it had received an allegation of fraud. A spokesman said: "Officers from the force''s economic crime directorate will consider the matter and establish whether or not it is appropriate to launch an investigation."</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/politics&k=Liam+Fox+and+Adam+Werritty+links&k=Politics&k=Liam+Fox&k=Adam+Werritty&k=UK+news&k=Defence+policy" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Adam+Werritty+may+be+investigated+for+fraud%2C+police+confirm+Article+1648318&ch=Politics&c2=60753&c4=Liam+Fox+and+Adam+Werritty+links+%28Politics%29%2CPolitics%2CLiam+Fox%2CAdam+Werritty%2CUK+news%2CDefence+policy%2CWilliam+Hague%2CConservatives&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=James+Meikle&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648318&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/2011/oct/16/adam-werrity-investigation-fraud-police|2011-10-16T21:13:16+01:00|c8a1f8ae28739f9abae50260bcc5a9fd44dcbb2c -->', NULL, 'Politics', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:19'),

Their future is bright', '<p>Even the sun glinting off Auckland Harbour could not dispel the morning-after feeling – not just for Wales''s sore-headed supporters but for rugby union itself. How often has the sport contrived to make a pig''s hearing-aid out of a heaven-sent opportunity, as happened on Saturday? Whether or not you are in touch with your inner jobsworth and think Sam Warburton merited his game-defining red card, this was not a contest in which justice was ultimately served.</p><p>Those of us who instinctively felt that Warburton had been treated harshly were reminded of Usain Bolt''s disqualification at the World Athletics Championships in August. Then, as now, a split-second false&nbsp;move devalued what had been among the sporting year''s most eagerly awaited moments.</p><p>Sooner rather than later, nevertheless, the Welsh squad will come to two realisations. The first is that they should have made a World Cup final even after playing with only 14 players, which is not something many teams have been able to say. An ounce more composure from either of their two fly-halves, James Hook and Stephen Jones, would have made a massive difference; even France readily conceded that the fates had smiled upon them at times.</p><p>And the second? Strip away the two agonising missed kicks that led to ill-deserved single-point defeats by the Springboks and the French and no team in the world has performed consistently better than Wales in these past six weeks. That might feel irrelevant at this moment but it should be some consolation once the immediate pain subsides. Not since the 1970s have so many neutrals gazed in admiration at a Welsh team and wished their own nations could harness the talent available to them to such stirring effect. Of course heroic failure is still failure but to suggest Wales are back at square one having not reached Sunday''s final is transparently absurd.</p><p>If good teams really do learn more from their defeats than their victories, the next four years could yet prove as fun as Saturday''s experience was depressing. Warburton, Toby Faletau, Dan Lydiate, George North, Rhys Priestland, Jonathan Davies and Leigh Halfpenny are all aged 24 or under. The outstanding Jamie Roberts turned 25 only this month. Where others agonise about whether Test rugby is too tough for their little darlings, the Wales coaching team have invited their best young players to take physical and mental responsibility regardless of age. It has been enlightening to watch and proof that he who dares wins more often than not.</p><p>Not, however, on this occasion. The two fans, dressed as gendarmes, who were waving plastic baguettes in front of the coaches'' box were less of a cliché than the 80 minutes France spent wrestling with their demons in public. Had Stephen Jones''s attempted conversion not ricocheted off the left-hand post, it would have been hard to imagine the French mounting a try-scoring response. Wise heads argued that they did not have two successive good performances in them, and so it proved. Only their defence and the steady head of their fly-half, Morgan Parra, who kicked three penalties and recorded a double-digit tackle count, did them much credit.</p><p>Mike Phillips, the scorer of the game''s only try after 59 minutes, had little doubt what the end-game will be. "France were poor and they are going to get blown away in the final," said the scrum-half. "It is as simple as that. The French didn''t do anything constructive on the pitch. All they did was look for penalties." The Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, more than a little pointedly, said he hoped Marc Lièvremont''s team would "play a lot more rugby" on Sunday.</p><p>We will never know what would have unfolded had the admirable Warburton stayed on. The early departure of the hugely influential tighthead prop Adam Jones also threatened Wales''s equilibrium but it was Priestland they missed most. Hook is heading off to play for Perpignan who, on this evidence, will be fearing they have made a costly mistake. Whether it was the scale of the occasion or the slippery playing surface – or both – the fly-half never looked comfortable and his fine eighth-minute penalty was by far his most authoritative contribution.</p><p>No one should underestimate Stephen Jones''s efforts for Wales over many years but he, too, shrank when it mattered. The most costly miss was not his conversion or a botched left-footed drop-goal attempt but the drop-goal opportunity he unaccountably ignored in the final quarter, with Wales controlling possession bang in front of the French sticks.</p><p>In mitigation Wales have put so much into their smartly run campaign that isolating one or two poor decisions would be unfair. Gatland now has a bronze-medal match to think about on Friday but he has established the&nbsp;necessary environment for future gilt-edged progress. The squad''s first game after the World Cup will be a commercially driven, opportunistic fixture against the&nbsp;Wallabies on 3&nbsp;December but beyond&nbsp;that lies a Six Nations of rapidly gathering intrigue.</p><p>As coincidence would have it, Wales will open their programme against their World Cup quarter-final foes, Ireland, in Dublin on 5 February and conclude with a potential title decider against France at the Millennium Stadium on 17&nbsp;March. Will the magic wear off as quickly as it arrived or will the dragon fly higher still? Assuming they can keep Gethin Jenkins and Adam Jones fit, it should be the latter. Matthew Rees, their injured hooker who had been due to lead&nbsp;this squad before having neck surgery, is hoping to return to club rugby on Saturday week.</p><p>The one certainty is that Warburton will now be driven on by a fierce desire for a happier outcome in 2015. England may be hosting the tournament in four years'' time but after this Wales will feel they have as realistic a chance as anyone else. While Ireland lament the gradual exodus of their golden generation and English rugby tears itself apart again the Welsh have more than enough maturing talent to soar above Saturday''s intense anticlimax.</p><p><strong>Wales</strong> Halfpenny; North, J Davies, Roberts, Shane Williams; Hook (S Jones, 46), Phillips; Jenkins, Bennett, A&nbsp;Jones (James, 10), Charteris, AW Jones (B Davies, 61), Lydiate (R Jones, 56), Warburton (capt), Faletau.</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Phillips <strong>Pen </strong>Hook.</p><p><strong>Sent-off</strong> Warburton 19.</p><p><strong>France</strong> Médard; Clerc, Rougerie, Mermoz, Palisson; Parra, Yachvili; Poux (Barcella, 45), Servat (Szarzewski, 45), Mas, Papé (Pierre, 61), Nallet, Dusautoir (capt), Bonnaire (Ouedraogo, 75), Harinordoquy.</p><p><strong>Pens</strong> Parra 3.</p><p><strong>Referee </strong>A Rolland (Ireland). <strong>Attendance</strong> 58,629.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=Rugby+World+Cup+2011&k=Wales+rugby+union+team&k=France+rugby+union+team&k=Rugby+union&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%3A+Wales+heroics+have+stirred+memories+of+Seventies+Article+1648321&ch=Sport&c2=60753&c4=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%2CWales+rugby+union+team%2CFrance+rugby+union+team%2CRugby+union%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Robert+Kitson+at+Eden+Park&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648321&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2011/oct/16/rugby-world-cup-2011-wales|2011-10-16T21:13:16+01:00|50c8d02522ad0f5749f48169910029f7fa0590cd -->', NULL, 'Sport', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:19');

We have two sons – 18 and 15. Having children who are approaching the time when they have to start thinking about jobs is extremely worrying, with employment amongst young people running at around 40%.</p><p>If Britain was experiencing the levels of unemployment there are here, especially with the relative lack of benefits, it would be unsustainable, but there is one very important difference, the role of the family. Spanish society is still essentially based around the family structure, with people helping and protecting each other accordingly.</p><p>Belief in the state and civil society is not as strong. It still seems quite alien to me, having been brought up on the British idea that if you are old enough to work and are not in full-time education you''re more or less expected to look after yourself, but at least in southern Spain, a great many well-educated young people (and that''s a high proportion because further education is very widespread) don''t really start thinking seriously about looking for work until their late twenties if not later, and are quite happy to stay close to the family nest.</p><p>Another factor is that wages have never been high here and the wage differentials are not as large as in Britain. Earning €50,000 a year is an extremely well-paid job and not many people earn that kind of money. There are a very large number of people earning between €1,000 and €2,000 a month, and anything above about €1,500 is considered to be quite good. This leads to a situation where people have more moderate ambitions.</p><p>That said, the cuts are biting hard and people have less money in their pockets. Banks have completely stopped lending money and businesses are suffering massively with problems of liquidity. "For rent" notices are increasingly common in closed down shops.</p><p>Large numbers of people work in the public sector and for local authorities, and they are being laid off or are simply owed ever growing amounts of wages. This is likely to get worse if and when the rightwing PP party wins the autumn elections, as expected. The PP are great admirers of the Cameron/Osborne approach.</p><p>As self-employed people, working largely in the languages sector, we have seen our income drop considerably. By cutting down radically on social activities like going out for drinks and meals etc, which is a central part of Spanish life, we can get by OK at the moment.</p><p>What seems to be true despite it all, though, is that perhaps because Spain has only been a fairly wealthy country for 30 years or so – following 40 years of hardship under Franco – many people are very stoical and seem to feel that things go in cycles. Ever-increasing wealth is perhaps not yet hardwired into the Spanish soul and people seem to feel that as long as they can afford a beer and a tapa, things will probably be alright."</p><p>• If you have a story to tell, know a person I should talk to or live in a place you think I should visit, please contact me: <a href="mailto:jon.henley@guardian.co.uk" title="">jon.henley@guardian.co.uk</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jonhenley" title="">@jonhenley</a> (the hashtag for this venture is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23EuroDebtTales" title="">#EuroDebtTales</a>)</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Spain&k=European+debt+crisis&k=Europe&k=World+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+%27stoical+Spanish+soul%27+seems+able+to+cope+with+hardship+Article+1648312&ch=World+news&c2=60753&c4=Spain+%28News%29%2CEuropean+debt+crisis%2CEurope%2CWorld+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jon+Henley&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648312&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/blog/2011/oct/16/stoical-spanish-soul-hardship|2011-10-16T21:13:17+01:00|83a11a64eafbdd441a54c718d4338c01f4d74b96 -->', NULL, 'World news', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:21'),

It found that some patients were dangerously underweight, with one resident found to be eating only two pieces of toast a day despite being prescribed a high calorie diet.</p><p>The director of the CQC is threatening legal action against one nursing home. The story raises the uncomfortable truth yet again about our oft disgraceful attitude towards older and vulnerable people in the UK.</p><p>The Observer''s front page leads with an accusation that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/oct/15/liam-fox-resignation-exposes-tories?newsfeed=true" title="guardian.co.uk: Liam Fox resignation exposes Tory links to US radical right">Cameron has allowed close links between members of his cabinet with US neocons</a>.

I thought the days where the wearing of short skirts was blamed for sexual assault, as opposed to the actual perpetrators, were over. Not so. The deputy director of children''s charity Kidscape is the voice of reason in this story. "Records of attacks on women and girls over the years have not followed hemlines, up or down," he said.

Having said that, Marc Lièvremont went to bed in a bad mood, and woke up in a good mood. So, that''s something.</p><p>It didn''t last too long. He had asked his players not to go out after their victory over Wales, conscious that the French celebrations in 1999, after the team in which he was wing-forward had beaten the All Blacks in the Sunday semi-final at Twickenham, had gone on for four days. They were not in the best condition to face Australia in the final, and here in Auckland he had asked the team of 2011 to be aware of what can happen. They went out anyway.</p><p>"I told them what I thought of them – that they''re a bunch of undisciplined spoilt brats, disobedient, sometimes selfish, always complaining, always whining. It''s been like this for four years," he said.</p><p>It was, he sighed, one of the "details," of France''s World Cup. One of those little things, wasn''t it, like, the night before, the players going in their bus straight to the car park at the back of the hotel and not stopping to acknowledge the fans, in their hundreds, who had gathered at the front? Lièvremont shrugged. "Thanks for bringing that up." Another detail. The coach had gone down to thank the supporters on behalf of the players.</p><p>Had the coach spoken to the players about this, about going out? "Yes." And? "They appreciated it."</p><p>It would appear that the big chill lives on in the French changing room. But, as their coach pointed out, "I don''t know if the better team won, but we''re in the final."</p><p>Others were not so pleased. "France in Final Insult," offered the Sunday Herald, referring to the lack of footie being played by the French team, their singular absence of ambition. "Now, that is insulting, to us," said Lièvremont.</p><p>To be fair to the France coach, it is precisely because his side refuses to embrace any style other than that of their own choosing that he is in a strange place with them. As in, shunned by them. He could praise their defensive work and their discipline, especially in the last phases of play, all 27 of them, when they denied Wales the position for a drop goal, but his exasperation, expressed in public, at what he perceives to be their fear of casting off their inhibitions has, as the saying goes, lost him the changing room.</p><p>He talked in general terms about what they would do this week but, given that he knows a lot about other details of his team''s behaviour, he could not go into the minutiae of their rugby. Because presumably they have not told him yet.</p><p>There was nothing wrong with the French lineout on Saturday, which means they will not be afraid to kick to touch in the final. Lionel Nallet and Imanol Harinordoquy picked off the Welsh throw in at will, even if there were no signs that their driving maul, usually a pretty useful tool if you are not going to entrust the ball to your three-quarters, was particularly well coordinated.</p><p>But to think they are going to try to win the World Cup by pinching ball at the lineout and mauling it forward is a dismal prospect. The final has not always been an outpouring of unfettered adventure, but nor has it rewarded complete negativity with the prize. France are going to have to earn it.</p><p>How though? They made all of one break against Wales and made all of about 10 paces as a collective. They thumped the ball down the field and into the corners. Please, may that not be good enough to win the World Cup. Not France.</p><p>Perhaps they think it is time somebody else brought the final stages of the tournament to life. After all, they have done more than their fair share of making sweet music: against Australia in 1987, South Africa in the semi of 1995, New Zealand in 1999 and 2007. Why should everyone expect France to be beautiful when the Cup tends to go to bulldozers: South Africa, England and Australia?</p><p>Because they are France, and they are not very good at pretending to be anyone else. Jacques Fouroux in the early 1980s tried to make them more Anglo-Saxon and measured but they were better off being unrestrained and unpredictable. How strange it is now that it is the players who have adopted caution, the tone set by their modern-day little generals, Morgan Parra and Dimitri Yachvili. Either the one kicked against Wales, or the other kicked.</p><p>At least the continuation of the policy will reduce the need for detail in training. Or perhaps, out of sight of their coach, they are planning something different. Alexis Palisson was protected against Wales from anything to do with the ball. Vincent Clerc had to survive a moment upside down at the hands of Sam Warburton, but the wings are fresh.</p><p>In their seventh and final match against New Zealand – "It has been my dream since childhood to play the All Blacks in a World Cup final," said Lièvremont – this may be priceless. To have wings who have grown accustomed to the conditions of springtime New Zealand and who remain hungry for the ball, to unleash them is all part of the grand plan. And coach and players will hug on Sunday, go out together and drink Auckland senseless. Please don''t take any of that as gospel.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=Rugby+World+Cup+2011&k=France+rugby+union+team&k=Marc+Li%C3%A8vremont&k=Sport&k=Rugby+union" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%3A+France+discord+dampens+Marc+Li%C3%A8vremont%27s+mood+Article+1648329&ch=Sport&c2=60753&c4=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%2CFrance+rugby+union+team%2CMarc+Lievremont%2CSport%2CRugby+union&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Eddie+Butler&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648329&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2011/oct/16/france-marc-lievremont-rugby-world-cup|2011-10-16T21:13:17+01:00|b93788b4db2d3caa55076cec0e2f75277b03b007 -->', NULL, 'Sport', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:21'),

This, he says, was one of the clearest indicators that the law which punishes the aiding, abetting or counselling of suicide with up to 14 years in prison is neither fair nor right.</p><p>James, who had played rugby for England as a teenager, committed suicide in a Swiss clinic after having become paralysed from the chest down in a training accident. After his death, the young man''s parents contacted police to admit that they had helped him achieve his wish to end "a second-class existence" by taking him abroad – despite praying to the last second, and beseeching him to change his mind.</p><p>Detective Inspector Adrian Todd and Detective Constable Michelle Cook told Falconer an investigation was still necessary. The Jameses were subjected to three hour-long interviews each, just five days after their son''s funeral. They endured a three-month wait as they grieved for their son, fearing they were to face prosecution and even jail.</p><p>"The very dry evidence from the police about their investigation of Dan James''s family [was emotional]," Falconer told the <em>Observer</em>. "The police officers that came were very sympathetic individuals, but they described a pretty chilling process. For them [the James family] the whole process had been beyond traumatic and you add to that the possibility of prosecution in circumstances where I don''t think anybody in the debate [about the law] wanted them to be prosecuted."</p><p>It is clear that Falconer, who in 2009 proposed in the Lords that assisted dying should be decriminalised, still believes change is needed. But while he entered the process focused on cases such as those of James and his family, he came out believing the issues were far broader than he had originally thought and touch everyone just as death touches us all.</p><p>The question, he says, is whether we want to be able to openly discuss death with doctors. Death, he said, was all too often an "un-thought-out process" that led to too many people dying "during the course of the night or morning in a cubicle with curtains around them". Each of us, he says, should instead have the opportunity to discuss how, where and when we will die. "Those discussions should take place much more often and much more openly than they do," Falconer said. "The question is whether or not in having a conversation with you should I be able to say, if I was a doctor, ''would you want a time where your death could be hastened because, for example, you felt life was empty or you couldn''t bear the suffering your family was going through?''</p><p>"Should [assisted dying] be one of the options that a doctor could discuss with his patient? That would depend on a change in the&nbsp;law."</p><p>Falconer, a close friend of Tony Blair, who "reluctantly" turned down an invitation to join Ed Miliband''s shadow cabinet, has sat as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/nov/28/assisted-dying-falconer-commission" title="">chairman of the Commission on Assisted Dying</a> since last September. It is a complicated issue for Falconer, that unleashes "fantastically strong feelings" in people.</p><p>While the law is clear that assisting someone to die is illegal, last year the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, produced guidelines to clarify when an individual might not face prosecution. It appears that relatives acting on compassionate grounds are unlikely to go to jail, but those acting in a professional capacity, such as those in the medical professions, are much more likely to face charges.</p><p>Yet activists against the legalisation of assisted death feel that even the production of the guidelines was a step down a slippery slope to encouraging vulnerable people to accept help to kill themselves and the idea of a commission to look at a change in the law is regarded as a huge and unacceptable step in itself. As part of the backlash, the independence of the commission has been rejected by some who have described it as a "sham" and refused to engage with it.</p><p>The commission is funded by the author Sir Terry Pratchett, who has Alzheimer''s disease, and by Bernard Lewis, founder of the River Island fashion chain, who has also expressed an interest in changing the law.</p><p>Others who have engaged with the process feel that offering the terminally ill or catastrophically physically impaired the possibility of receiving help to die is an explicit judgment on the value of those people''s lives.</p><p>Yet the Labour peer says there is still a case for change. "First of all, [the current legal position] doesn''t provide any certainty," Falconer explained. "Secondly, it favours the rich and not the poor, because what it means is that if you have got the money you can go to Switzerland and be assisted, whereas in the UK medical assistance is almost certain to put the medical professional in danger of being prosecuted. It also has the constitutional problem that the law is one thing but that whether it is being enforced is decided by a well-meaning official rather than by what parliament decided was the law."</p><p>Falconer says he is clear the commission does not want to propose anything that could be described as euthanasia and has concluded that the systems in Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal, would be unacceptable in the UK. His commission is set to offer a British, "gradualist" alternative.</p><p>The details are likely to be published next month, but he is happy to hint at their direction of travel.</p><p>"Any change in the law would simply involve: ''It still remains an offence to assist someone to commit suicide unless certain specified safeguards have been gone through.'' I don''t know where we are going to get to in relation of safeguards, but the choice is do you want a system that doesn''t look at the issue before the assisted suicide and rely on the investigation and the possibility of criminal charges?</p><p>"Is that the way to safeguard people? Or is the better way to safeguard people to keep the law as it is but have an exception if certain steps have been taken?"</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/society&k=Assisted+suicide&k=Law&k=Society&k=UK+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Suicide+of+Dan+James+convinced+Lord+Falconer+that+the+law+had+to+change+Article+1648340&ch=Society&c2=60753&c4=Assisted+suicide+%28Society%29%2CLaw%2CSociety%2CUK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Daniel+Boffey&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648340&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: society/2011/oct/16/suicide-dan-james-law-change|2011-10-16T21:13:18+01:00|f78b4e8bb591e18f4ca415bcc663a65820f552ff -->', NULL, 'Society', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:21'),

I suppose the situation, from my point of view, is just if and when the decision is finally made regarding what''s happening with Carlos at Manchester City, then perhaps my co-chairman, David Sullivan, might want to pursue it. If we could get him back here, based on what he did here last time, and if he did love the club as much as he did, and if it was a possibility, then I think it''s an outside chance."</p><p>But owing to Tevez''s acrimonious dispute with City, following his apparent refusal to come on as a substitute in a Champions League group game against Bayern Munich, the club is in no mood to cushion the blow of his likely exclusion from the first team by paying a large percentage of his salary to aid any move away.</p><p>Another stumbling block is that with City''s internal disciplinary procedure plus appeals system potentially taking up to six weeks, Tevez would not be available until early December at the earliest. However, it is a fluid situation at Eastlands and no options are being definitively closed off by City.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/football&k=Carlos+Tevez&k=West+Ham+United&k=Manchester+City&k=Sam+Allardyce&k=Football&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=West+Ham%27s+hopes+of+signing+Carlos+Tevez+likely+to+come+to+nothing+Article+1648339&ch=Football&c2=60753&c4=Carlos+Tevez%2CWest+Ham+United+%28Football%29%2CManchester+City+%28Football%29%2CSam+Allardyce%2CFootball%2CSport&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jamie+Jackson&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648339&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: football/2011/oct/16/carlos-tevez-west-ham-loan|2011-10-16T21:13:18+01:00|36bc8015f205dcc24b43ff7182216b83c5824981 -->', NULL, 'Football', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:21'),

"I''m all right with them having a backheel but it''s kind of taking the piss and rubbing people''s noses in it [to do that with the shirt] when you''re getting beaten." </p><p>Scharner disputed that he was guilty of anything inflammatory. "My kids gave it to me, it''s just a T-shirt with a big Albion logo on it and that''s what I showed to the supporters," he said.</p><p>Wolves, in truth, have bigger issues to worry about. They face Swansea City at home on Saturday and will have to show a marked improvement at both ends of the pitch if they are to get out of their current rut. Roger Johnson was particularly poor here and will be keen to see the back of the outstanding Shane Long, whose movement and pace troubled the Wolves captain throughout. </p><p>Wolves fell behind in the eighth minute. Billy Jones, who impressed on his Premier League debut, ran on to Youssouf Mulumbu''s pass before expertly cutting the ball back for Brunt to sweep home. Kevin Doyle came close to equalising six minutes later and Johnson squandered a decent chance in the second half. </p><p>West Brom, however, always looked menacing and it was no surprise when they added a second goal, Scharner''s neat backheel inviting Odemwingie to drill into the bottom corner.

There may be thunder too. "We will definitely feel a chill in the air," Ratcliffe said. "The winds originate in the Arctic, but they get modified a lot as they arrive here."</p><p>He added: "It''s going to be pretty cold everywhere across the UK on Wednesday night, with widespread ground frost expected in the whole of the UK and perhaps air frost in places too."</p><p>Forecasters at the Met Office also believe the Pennines and parts of Snowdonia may also see snow within days with plenty of blustery showers elsewhere. Conditions could be milder and more typically autumnal by the end of the week as a result of weather systems moving in from the Atlantic and it will be pretty unsettled.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Weather&k=UK+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Weather+expected+to+turn+much+colder+before+clocks+go+back+Article+1648346&ch=UK+news&c2=60753&c4=Weather+UK+%28News%29%2CUK+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=James+Meikle&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648346&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2011/oct/16/weather-expected-to-turn-colder|2011-10-16T21:13:20+01:00|f8b3d6df10a5910b1e7da2483235616e15941462 -->', NULL, 'UK news', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:23'),

Inside, she visits Ukraine''s most famous political prisoner – her mother, Yulia Tymoshenko.</p><p>Tymoshenko has called the cold walls of the 150-year-old prison home since 5 August, when she was detained for disrupting the court in the middle of her trial on charges of abusing her power while signing a gas deal with Russia as prime minister in 2009.</p><p>Last week, she was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/11/yulia-tymoshenko-jailed-ukraine-pariah" title="">found guilty</a> and handed a seven-year sentence, and ordered to pay £120m in damages.</p><p>"It''s simply a trial of revenge, a trial to show other opponents ''don''t come out, don''t raise your head, don''t try to fight with us''," Carr said by telephone from Kiev, her voice tired and strained.</p><p>Carr, 31, sat dutifully by Tymoshenko''s side as the judge read his sentence last week, exchanging whispers and leaning her head on her mother''s shoulder as it became clear that, despite intense international pressure, the fiery opposition leader would be put away.</p><p>At first, there was hope – President Viktor Yanukovych, keenly aware that a guilty verdict would damage his desire for closer ties with the EU, hinted at changes in the criminal code that would set Tymoshenko free.</p><p>Then, two days after the verdict was handed down, prosecutors opened a second criminal case against Tymoshenko on accusations of embezzling £250m while president of United Energy Systems of Ukraine, a gas trading company, in 1997.</p><p>"We were shocked," said Carr, who lives in the Ukrainian capital with her British rock singer husband, Sean Carr.</p><p>"It just shows they''re moving along with their plan of the destruction of political opponents."</p><p>Tymoshenko and her supporters insist Yanukovych orchestrated the campaign against her to rid Ukraine of one of its most popular politicians, and his chief political rival. Yanukovych has denied the allegation.</p><p>Tymoshenko remains inside Lukyanivska, which functions mainly as a pre-trial detention centre. She shares a 15 sq m space with two other women, both awaiting charges on economic crimes.</p><p>There is a small window, covered with three sets of bars. There is no hot water and the thick walls of the 19th-century prison keep its interior cold and damp. Tymoshenko spends her days reading.</p><p>"Now she will have more work to do, reading the documents for the new criminal case," said Carr.</p><p>Visits are limited to close family members and lawyers, with all other visitor requests denied.</p><p>"She used to go for walks in the courtyard, but she cannot move that much now because of the pain," said Carr.</p><p>Tymoshenko''s family said the stress of the trial, coupled with poor conditions inside the jail, had exacerbated the 50-year-old''s health issues – a bad back and stomach problems.</p><p>"One week after she was arrested she started to have symptoms – bruises, haematomas on her skin. We still don''t know what it is," said Carr.</p><p>Prison officials have denied Tymoshenko''s request to receive a visit from her doctor.</p><p>Despite all that, Tymoshenko takes care to keep up her appearance, including what is arguably the world''s most famous plait.</p><p>"She looks good,she''s trying, she does her hair," said Carr. "She doesn''t want to upset us, to show her state of mind."</p><p>Tymoshenko''s immaculate appearance in the Kiev courtroom last week was only marred by a couple of inches of root growth, a testament to the time she has spent imprisoned.</p><p>Tymoshenko appears acutely aware of the political capital she is acquiring. Long a divisive figure, among her supporters she has managed to cast off the reputation of being Ukraine''s Gas Princess, a title bestowed upon her in the 1990s when she profited handsomely from the country''s chaotic post-Soviet economy.</p><p>"She remains strong," said Carr. "She''s ready to go on and fight through this. It shows she''s a real leader, that she''s not going to go for any compromise, for any negotiations with this regime."</p><p>Some have compared her plight to that of jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who has managed to reshape himself from reviled oligarch to Russian voice of conscience thanks to two politicised trials and a lengthy jail sentence.</p><p>There is still speculation that Tymoshenko could be released. Some observers had believed Yanukovych would attempt to reach some sort of compromise before 20 October, when he is due to fly to Brussels to finalise the details of a free trade agreement that has been touted as a key step in Ukraine''s long search to solidify relations with the EU.</p><p>The EU has warned Ukraine that it sees the trial as politically motivated and warned relations will have to be reconsidered.</p><p>"The president and his team are aimed at removing their political opponents no matter what," said Carr.</p><p>"They don''t listen to any messages from the world – they''re aimed at destroying their main political opponent. And it seems they''re not going to stop at anything."</p><p>Carr recalls her mother''s brief arrest in February 2001, on charges of document forgery and tax evasion dating to the mid-1990s. The charges were quickly dropped.</p><p>"Ten years ago, she was jailed for exactly the same reason," she said. "It''s the same scenario, the same actors.</p><p>"I want my mother back home and I don''t want her to be part of this political fight all the time.</p><p>"Sometimes it comes to a point when I just want her out of it, we just want her to have a normal life.</p><p>"But if you remove politics from her life, she would not be able to live.

Tony Adams can be the new "Per Mertesacker", oh hang on, Per Mertesacker can be the "new Tony Adams". Or something like that. And with Laurent Koscielny and Johan Djourou on their way back to full fitness, Wenger believes his defence can plug the leaks. Now considering those two were at the heart of the defence on that shambolic day at Old Trafford, he may need to give his rose-tinted glasses a little wipe and reassess things. Thomas Vermaelen would make a difference if he came back, mind, but he''s still a couple of weeks away, and given the amount of time he''s been out he may take a while to regain the kind of form he showed when he was signed a couple of years ago. Wenger''s biggest challenge will be how to shore up the right full-back spot since Bacary Sagna broke his leg. Carl Jenkinson, despite his promise, hardly had any experience in League One with Charlton, so to ask him to replace Sagna, who has been a fixture in the Arsenal side for years now, is a big ask.</p><p>Mind you, things aren''t all that rosy at Sunderland. At boardroom level the club is unstable, Steve Bruce is under intense pressure after spending big and delivering little, and fans are understandably miffed. </p><p>The good omen for the Mackems, though, is that the last time they won away at Arsenal (in 1983) the Brinks Mat Robbery took place. There''s been another huge theft this year that''s been big in this newsroom. My colleague Jacob Steinberg''s iPod was stolen … IN GUARDIAN TOWERS! Yes, you may think these offices are a utopian haven free from the evil of the world, but nobody''s safe.

It would work on like multiple levels!" whoops Ryan Dunne. Sorry to whazz on your parade, Ryan, but I imagine it would fail when the comments section degenerates into a competition to see who can create the best Roughley-related pun.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class="timestamp">1.27pm:</span> Well, it''s almost time to kick-off. Especially for Lee Cattermole. I expect he will try to break up play in midfield whenever he can. My prediction is a booking for Cattermole inside 25 minutes. He can''t help himself. Arteta''s probably wearing two pairs of socks around his ankles.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class="timestamp">Goal! Arsenal 1-0 Sunderland (Van Persie 1min):</span>  What a start! With 27 seconds on the clock, Rosicky clips a ball down the inside-left channel to Gervinho. He races 20 yards forwards under no pressure, turns inside and plays a simple square ball to Van Persie, 20 yards from goal. With Wes Brown standing off him, Van Persie takes one touch and picks his spot in the bottom right-hand corner of Sunderland''s goal perfectly.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class="timestamp">3 min:</span> Steve Bruce will have felt the air get a little heavier around his shoulders as that ball went in. Sunderland''s defence were lethargic, to say the least. O''Shea didn''t get half as close to Gervinho as he should have been and, despite Van Persie''s clever step back away from Brown, some effort could have been made to block his shot.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class="timestamp">7 min:</span> Arsenal have settled into this like they''re wearing slippers. It''s a pity so many Arsenal fans haven''t turned up at the Emirates to watch them. They might have seen a decent match, given the home side''s showing so far. Gervinho shifts his weight right and left and knocks the ball to the byline before crossing low to Van Persie, but Brown clears for a corner.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class="timestamp">9 min:</span> Corner comes to nowt, mind. Sunderland have their first attack after a long punt upfield by Mignolet. They win a corner on the left, but it''s about as effective as Arsenal''s.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class="timestamp">11 min:</span> Van Persie produces a wonderful piece of skill. Arteta plays a simple ball to him on the right corner of the penalty area, where the Dutch striker spins Richardson with such speed and grace that the defender''s left looking like he''s been ditched on the dancefloor. Van Persie then does a Cantona and chips Minolet from 18 yards, but as the ball sails towards the left hand corner it clips the post and bounces across the goal-line to be cleared. Deserved a goal. It was lovely.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><span class="timestamp">14 min:</span> Now if Jamie Redknapp was to describe how Van Persie was playing at the moment it would be H .. L....... O. F...  You can fill in the blanks. He''s playing brilliantly though. He strikes narrowly wide from the edge of the box after another incisive move in midfield. Sunderland can''t string a pass together. They''ve not turned up.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><span class="timestamp">17 min:</span> Here''s our European scout Rob Moline. "Best right-back going round at the moment is Mauricio Isla at Udinese - everyone was raving about Alexis Sanchez last year getting Udinese into Big Cup, but every time you watched them you saw Isla flashing past him forwards in attack and backwards in defence - he is fit! (in the aerobic capacity sense). Starred for Chile in the World Cup, too, again alongside Sanchez. I kinda hope he ends up at Barça replacing Dani Alves, Arsenal has jumped the shark but Barça are still pretty good*. Barça missed a trick not signing the two of them in summer." Van Persie almost causes Wes Brown to break his ankle as he flicks the ball from right to left at lightspeed and then tries to slip Gervinho in through a gap in Sunderland''s defence. O''Shea gets a foot to it and Van Persie tries to hook a second pass back into the danger area, but Mignolet gathers comfortably.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><span class="timestamp">20 min:</span> Larsson bundles Arteta over in midfield. Where''s Cattermole? I haven''t seen him touch the ball or kick anyone yet. Gervinho is causing Sunderland all kinds of problems on the left. O''Shea is caught out for pace again, with Brown having to cover for his former Manchester United team-mate and deflect Gervinho''s cross out for a corner. The corner is swung deep by Arteta to the backpost where Sunderland don''t deal with it and Mignolet collects at the second attempt.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class="timestamp">24 min:</span> Arsenal build another attack from the back with such ease. Song, Rosicky and Arteta are shifting the ball so quickly that Sunderland''s midfield three can''t get close to them. Gervinho is involved in another Arsenal attack, cutting inside his marker just outside the box and slamming a shot against Brown. That Tony Adams is doing well at the back too.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class="timestamp">27 min:</span> Oh, hang on. This wouldn''t have happened if Adams was captain. Koscielny doesn''t listen to Mertesacker as he pushes forwards to play Sessegnon offside and the Sunderland winger is sent scuttling clear on the left. Szczesny rushes out 10 yards outside his area on the left but misses the tackle. Sessegnon turns inside and looks for Vaughan rushing into the box, but Song clears after tracking back diligently. That was very ''new Arsenal''.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class="timestamp">Goal! Arsenal 1-1 Sunderland (Larsson 31 min):</span> A wonderful free-kick from Seb Larsson. Arteta did a Cattermole on Cattermole and smacked him with an errant elbow when jumping for a ball on the edge of the Arsenal box. A free-kick is given and up steps the former Arsenal player. The ball is dead centre 25 yards out. He runs left to right at it and whips it viciously over the wall and into the top left-hand corner at terrific speed. Szczesny had no chance.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class="timestamp">32 min:</span> Well that was a turn up for the books. Arsenal have been completely dominant. Sunderland haven''t done a tap all game. Suddenly Steve Bruce''s side have a head of steam.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><span class="timestamp">34 min:</span> Sunderland work the ball out to Sessegnon on the left, who has again got clear of Jenkinson. The forward looks more surprised than anything else as he wanders into the Arsenal box unchallenged. He does well to hold the ball up and then clip a wonderful ball past Mertesacker to Cattermole, who races in at the backpost and fires a header from two yards at goal, to be denied by a wonderful block from Szczesny, who flings himself in front of it.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><span class="timestamp">38 min:</span> This has suddenly become one of those games for Arsenal.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><span class="timestamp">39 min:</span> Cattermole locates his studs and uses them to good effect to give away a needless free-kick 35 yards from goal. I didn''t see whose ankles felt their steeliness, but there''s no lasting damage and no yellow card for Cattermole either.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><span class="timestamp">41 min:</span> Rosicky pirouettes away from Cattermole in midfield. Drawing the tackle and then giving himself space. He works the ball to Song, who launches an attack on the right, which finally results in a corner on the left. Despite the towering presence of Mertesacker and Song in the box, there''s no great threat as the ball is flicked up into the air by the big German and eventually headed softly at goal by Song.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class="timestamp">43 min:</span> It''s gone a bit flat. Nothing to see here. "Hi Gregg, nice to see from Wenger''s quotes that it''s not just the English that resort to lazy nationalistic clichés - "Trust the Germans, they can fight." What''s the French for "they don''t like it up ''em"? To answer Patrick Cullen''s question it''s Ils ne l''aiment pas à eux.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><span class="timestamp">45 min:</span> Larsson is left unmarked at the backpost. He heads the ball back across goal where Colback pokes a toe out and sends the ball just a yard over. That would have been a real kick in the teeth for Arsenal. Though after conceding those familiar jitters have seeped into their play like a nasty virus.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class="timestamp">Half-time</span><br />Is Rosicky like that kid in the Sixth Sense? "I noticed that Rosicky didn''t even turn to see the ball go in the net from the free-kick but had a knowing look on his face. Same thing happened in the Man U Arsenal game when Rooney scored," begins Craig Kilgour. "Does Rosicky know the flight so well he can feel it''s already a goal or does he just not bother following up? I know he got stick on MOTD in the Man U game for it."</p><!-- Block 25 --><p>Looking back at the first-half highlights it''s extraordinary that Arsenal have gone in level. There was only one team playing football until Larsson''s free-kick. Since then, Sunderland have started to pass the ball, win tackles, chase lost causes and they''ve looked, well, like they give a toss. Which they didn''t for the first half an hour. </p><p><strong>I saw a good film last night:</strong> Midnight in Paris by Woody Allen. Go see it. If you like Wes Anderson films it''ll be up your street.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class="timestamp">45 min:</span> The teams are back out at a sparse looking Emirates Stadium. Arsenal are kicking from right to left on my little screen, with Sunderland in light blue pointing the other way, so draw a picture of that in your minds.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class="timestamp">46 min:</span> Gervinho miscontrols in the middle of a promising attack and the ball squirts loose to Cattermole. He looks to set Sessegnon clear down the right-hand channel but Koscielny tracks back and Arsenal win back possession.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><span class="timestamp">48 min:</span> Apparently Steve Bruce went to Asia in the international break to try and promote Sunderland. As if he hasn''t suffered enough this season. I imagine lots of blank faces greeted him, poor sod. Arsenal are dominating possession again as they did in the first 30 minutes of the first half.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><span class="timestamp">50 min:</span> Walcott picks the ball up on the right and works his way into the Sunderland penalty area. He plays a low cross across the six-yard box, which Mignolet tries to grab, but pushes out into the crowded penalty area where a collection of legs make a hash of clearing it, resulting in a corner ... which comes to nowt.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><span class="timestamp">51 min:</span> Kieran Gibbs off, Andre Santos on. The young left back must have picked up a knock.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><span class="timestamp">52 min:</span> Rosicky races through the middle of midfield and gets hauled down by a cynical challenge by Vaughan, who is rightly booked. Arsenal make a right pig''s ear of a short-free kick, though, which Van Persie ends up skying. It was the antithesis of the class he showed in the first half.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><span class="timestamp">55 min:</span> Sunderland have collectively sharpened their studs. Larsson is booked for clattering into Van Persie midway inside Sunderland''s half.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><span class="timestamp">56 min:</span> Rosicky plays a glorious ball all of 40 yards from left to right, landing the leather on Walcott''s toe. He plays a game of who-can-run-fastest with Kieran Richardson down the right wing (it''s a dead heat) with his cross hitting the full-back''s arm inside the area, and Arsenal fans shouting for a penalty, which it would have been harsh to award, as his arms were pretty much against his body.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><span class="timestamp">59 min:</span> Arsenal win a free-kick in the exacts same spot 25 yards from goal where Larsson scored his pearler from in the first half. But the Spaniard curls an ugly effort over by at least 10 yards. Poor.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><span class="timestamp">60 min:</span> Sunderland are racking the free-kicks up. If there was an orange card for an offence somewhere between yellow and red, Wes Brown would be a candidate after his cynical tackle on Theo Walcott right on the edge of the box on the left-hand side. The defender slides into Walcott with no hope of winning the ball as he races through. Walcott fancies his chances after seeing Arteta''s dreadful attempt, but his curled effiort is almost as bad, flying way over the bar in an attempt at finding the top right-hand corner.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><span class="timestamp">64 min:</span> "I''m a little late to this party, but I noticed Ryan Dunne''s comment about "Bakowski," your soon-to-be "cool NY Jewish intellectual Beat Poet style" name. Not to be pedantic, but is he thinking of Charles Bukowski, who emerged as a literary icon from the streets of South Central Los Angeles? Not that you care about my opinion, but if I were you, I''d stay Roughley but maybe change your first name to Greg to simplify things. And you''re right, Midnight in Paris was really good. I''m intrigued by all of these post-New York Woody Allen movies. I think Cassandra''s Dream was underrated, what do you think?" I haven''t seen it but if I did I''d probably think that his 2007 <em>excursion to the dark side of human nature, is good enough that you may wonder why he doesn''t just stop making comedies once and for all</em>. Not that I''ve copied and pasted an opinion on it from another website or anything. Van Persie sidefoots an effort straight at Mignolet from a narrowing angle 10 yards out on the left.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><span class="timestamp">67 min:</span> Dong-Won Ji replaces Sunderland''s free-kick scoring Seb Larsson. And Andrey Arshavin replaces Gervinho. I''m surprised by that. He''s caused Sunderland''s defence an awful lot of problems with his pace and all round jinkery.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><span class="timestamp">68 min:</span> Michael Turner stops Arshavin in his tracks with a joyful block tackle. It really was joyful. Stopped Arshavin dead with a lovely thumping sound.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><span class="timestamp">71 min:</span> Sunderland are looking a bit more comfortable now. They''re reading Arsenal''s passes better and the tension around the Emirates is palpable. Song nutmegs Cattermole beautifully and strides onto his handy bit of work before ruining it all with an overhit pass towards Walcott, who was darting into the box on the right side. Groan!</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><span class="timestamp">73 min:</span> There was a flash of retro-Arshavin about the little Russian''s attack just then. He burst into the box and slalomed through O''Shea, Brown and Turner before poking a shot a yard wide from 15 yards. Would have been a lovely goal, for sure, with a dash of 2008 about it.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><span class="timestamp">76 min:</span> Rosicky off and Yossi Benayoun on for Arsenal. Meanwhile, here''s my impact sub Gary Naylor: "Just as the best organised teams find a way to win, those not organised well find a way to avoid winning. No surprise to me that Arsenal have gone in level. Wenger''s management is like Paul McCartney''s career. Blazing start then a long descent into vague ill-focused stuff ameliorated by a very occasional highlight. And living off past greatest hits." Ameliorated? Quick look up in the dictionary. Yup, that makes sense.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><span class="timestamp">78 min:</span> Arsenal are pushing on with a bit more urgency now. Arshavin has had an immediate impact. He curls a dangerous cross towards Van Persie on the back post, but Wes Brown leaps highest and heads the ball out for a corner.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><span class="timestamp">79 minutes:</span> Sessegnon off and Conor Wickham on for Sunderland. A big man up top. Just the man to give Arsenal the jitters again if Sunderland were to get a corner with minutes to go.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><span class="timestamp">80 min:</span> "Song picks up possession and looks towards a packed midfield for a pass. He finds Benayoun, who shifts the ball quickly to Van Persie, he spins too quickly for Brown and wins a free-kick in the kind of territory he will love to have a go from.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><span class="timestamp">Goal! Arsenal 2-1 Sunderland (82 min):</span> Another fantastic free-kick! That''s perfectly placed into the top corner and richly deserved. The Dutchman took one look up and curled it deliciously over the wall (which can''t be blamed) and into the postage stamp at the top right-hand corner of Sunderland''s goal. Van Persie has been purring all day.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><span class="timestamp">84 min:</span> Dong Won-ji has a goal disallowed after turning in the Arsenal box. He was half a yard offside, but for a moment the crowd didn''t know it. Arsenal need to show a bit of backbone now and unlearn that ability they have of finding a way to cock things up.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><span class="timestamp">87 min:</span> Craig Gardner is on for Lee Cattermole. Sunderland appeal for a penalty after Theo Walcott at once gets a toe to the ball and Colback''s foot. The Sunderland player goes down but is quickly told to get on his feet again by Howard Webb.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><span class="timestamp">88 min:</span> "Since this match is probably as exciting on TV as it is on MBM, maybe your readers would like to hear my Superstar Donkey story," writes Alix Sharkey JUST AS THE MATCH IS GETTING EXCITING! "In 1994 I was in a London nightclub called The End, standing at a bar eight deep waiting to get two beers. Having claimed them I turned and to my amazement, recognized the bloke waiting patiently behind me. ''Tony Adams!'' I exclaimed. He smiled broadly but glanced from side to side in a ''don''t break my cover'' kind of way. As we shook hands I said, ''I''m a Spurs fan,'' just to watch his smile turn into a grimace. But he was very magnanimous, and we chatted for a few minutes. About an hour later I found him leaning against a pillar and remarked on his enormous feet, swatched in brown brogues. ''They''re size 12s,'' he conceded. ''But useful on the pitch.'' At that point a very sexy woman in a green minidress walked between us, caught her toe on Adams'' oversize plates, and went sprawling face-first. He looked at me with a wry smile. ''Told you,'' he said."</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><span class="timestamp">90 min:</span> Theo Walcott cuts inside Richardson and accelerates into the box. He looks up but does a very Walcott thing and picks the wrong option. Well, gives it straight to a Sunderland defender to be exact.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><span class="timestamp">90+1 min:</span> There''s five minutes of injury time. Wenger''s having a good old moan about that. Arsenal are tidy in possession though and, dare I say it, composed at the moment. That Tony Adams story has got me thinking about a similar experience I had in Liverpool with Erik Meijer. Not quite in Adams''s star category, admittedly. But a cult hero in his own clumsy way.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><span class="timestamp">90+3min:</span> Sunderland get hold of possession at last. Wickham tries a shot from long range which Mertesacker blocks. Benayoun breaks and Arsenal try to work the ball to Van Persie, but Sunderland clear and then win a free-kick.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><span class="timestamp">90+5min:</span> Mignolet lofts the free-kick high into Arsenal''s penalty area where the whole of Sunderland''s outfield players are gathered. The ball is overhit though and goes out for a goal-kick, much to the relief of the Arsenal fans. Peep! It''s all over.</p><!-- Block 53 --><h2>Full-time</h2><p>Well Arsenal get the three points, which they deserve given their dominance for 75 minutes of the match. Robin van Persie showed why he is now Arsenal''s most important player. At times he was unplayable, but his good work can often be undone by the lack of confidence that leaks into the team when they concede a goal. And what a goal. There was no blame to be attached to any Arsenal player, it was just an amazing free-kick by Larsson. Steve Bruce can be satisfied that his team found their fight at last after the goal and only another piece of brilliance by Van Persie prevented them from getting a point. He''s still under shed loads off pressure, mind. I''ll leave the final word to Neil Brown: "I saw ''Midnight In Paris'' a few days ago and really enjoyed it; really witty and charming. The fella who played Hemmingway was as good as Adrien Brody''s Dali was bad. The theme of the film is particularly prescient for fans of Arsenal (my team) and Liverpool (your team, I believe); namely that nostalgia only gets a person so far and one needs to embrace, and make the most of, the present. I also saw ''Drive'', which was incredibly exciting, well put together yet look-away-now violent, and all the better for it. Is that one for Stoke fans?"</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/football&k=Premier+League+2011-12&k=Arsenal&k=Sunderland&k=Premier+League&k=Sport&k=Football" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Arsenal+v+Sunderland+%7C+Gregg+Roughley+Article+1648328&ch=Football&c2=60753&c4=Premier+League+2011-12%2CArsenal+FC+%28Football%29%2CSunderland+%28Football%29%2CPremier+League+%28Football%29%2CSport%2CFootball&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Gregg+Roughley&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648328&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: football/2011/oct/16/arsenal-sunderland-live|2011-10-16T21:13:21+01:00|39f6364e8bc8cebeb9a8441c32d701fe913d2860 -->', NULL, 'Football', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:25'),

He won a free-kick from Wes Brown after a surging run and, having placed the ball, sent it spinning over the defensive wall and into the top corner. If his team were just about value for the win, he fully deserved his ovation at full-time.</p><p>Van Persie''s dream calendar year goes on. His two goals here took his tally for Arsenal to 28 in 34 games. It is little wonder that the club are desperate for him to extend his contract beyond June 2013 and why the Dutchman''s preference for waiting until next summer to open talks has prompted such anxiety.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the ideal situation does not exist often," said the manager, Arsène Wenger. "The ideal situation is that he extends his length of contract but if he does not, we have to respect that. What is important is that he plays like he plays. For me, commitment is not how long you are at the club, it is as long as you are there, you give 100 per cent until the last day of your contract.</p><p>"Robin knows that we are ready to talk. The most important thing is what you do today and how much you are committed to the cause for as long as you are at the club."</p><p>Van Persie has grown weary of the furore surrounding his desire to postpone the contract discussions, which has been interpreted as a sign that he does not want to commit long-term just yet. He was asked after the game whether his future was at the club. "I''m committed, as I said," he replied. "This is my eighth year. If you can see one player who is committed, it is me."</p><p>Nobody doubts Van Persie''s commitment when he crosses the white line and it was his impishness that inspired Arsenal to a fine start. He punished Sunderland for their early sleepwalking with a predator''s finish on 29&nbsp;seconds, which was Arsenal''s quickest goal of the Premier League era. The  he almost added a gem. Having beaten Kieran Richardson with a languid Cruyff-turn, he chipped sumptuously towards the left top corner: think Eric Cantona for Manchester United against Sunderland in 1996. Unlike Cantona, however, he was denied by the woodwork.</p><p>Arsenal were in charge midway through the first-half but by half-time had surrendered the lead and were fortunate not to be trailing. It was a shocking turnaround and they left the field to a smattering of boos. Wenger spoke of a "confidence wobble" and it represented further evidence of his team''s brittleness. Sunderland''s equaliser came after Mikel Arteta''s needless handball gave Sebastien Larsson the opportunity of a free-kick from 25 yards and the former Arsenal midfielder curled the ball to perfection.</p><p>Bruce''s team went for the jugular and he felt that the result would have been different if Lee Cattermole had converted a header from point-blank range, rather than seen Wojciech Szczesny save sharply. Jack Colback also volleyed over when well placed. Van Persie''s brilliance ensured that Arsenal escaped with the three points.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/football&k=Premier+League+2011-12&k=Arsenal&k=Sunderland&k=Football&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Arsenal+2-1+Sunderland+%7C+Premier+League+match+report+Article+1648369&ch=Football&c2=60753&c4=Premier+League+2011-12%2CArsenal+FC+%28Football%29%2CSunderland+%28Football%29%2CFootball%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=David+Hytner+at+Emirates+Stadium&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648369&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: football/2011/oct/16/arsenal-sunderland-premier-league|2011-10-16T21:13:21+01:00|05336a0a45a4ed28a8258a6062e228828467682f -->', NULL, 'Football', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:25'),

No&nbsp;one will be warier than the Kiwis of celebrating prematurely but the manner in which they tied the Wallabies down in a&nbsp;one-sided semi-final was deeply ominous for France. If the hosts lose Sunday''s final it will be a result beyond most people''s comprehension, the French included.</p><p>Because this was the All Blacks as they would love the world to see them: tough, mean, committed and ruthless in every department, save the goalkicking. Had Piri Weepu and Aaron Cruden not missed five kicks between them, the Australians would have been royally stuffed and roasted, as opposed to merely flattened. Jerome Kaino, Kieran Read, Brad Thorn and Richie McCaw do not have the air of chokers about them; behind the scrum Cory Jane gave one of the great aerial catching exhibitions and Israel Dagg again showed himself to be a monumental talent. Given the amount of tension floating around before kick‑off and the unavailability of the fly-half Dan Carter, it amounted to pure bliss, from a Kiwi perspective.</p><p>"I thought it was an outstanding performance and I''m very proud of them," said the All Blacks'' head coach, Graham Henry, having left his old adversary Robbie Deans face down in the dust. "We just need to build again for next weekend and do the same thing, hopefully."</p><p>Lest it be forgotten, Henry and co have a score to settle with the French, having lost to them in Cardiff in the 2007 quarter-final. Had he enjoyed this experience a little more? "A bit better than last time," was the laconic reply. "We''ve got a lot of history with France in World Cups. We respect them and it''s going to be another big game next week. But the job hasn''t been done. It''s very important we understand that."</p><p>Even Deans, though, reckons the All Blacks are on course to end 24 years of emptiness. "They''ll take a lot of stopping from here," said Australia''s coach, a former All Black who was once in charge of the Crusaders. "They''re experienced, they''re well‑versed, they''re hungry and they''ve got a lot of support about them. They showed tonight they''re more than capable of winning it." What did he say to Henry, someone asked, when the pair shook hands at the end? "Well done," Deans replied, a little tersely.</p><p>There was nothing else he could say. The first quarter was as good as anything the All Blacks have managed under Henry against the Wallabies, who have not won in Auckland since 1986. Caught in the eye of the storm was Quade Cooper, who had already received a reception from the home supporters that fell some way short of rapturous. The Wallaby fly-half''s kick-off sailed out on the full, high balls were spilled and clearance kicks sliced wickedly into touch. In the sixth minute Dagg skipped outside him and threw an inside pass to Ma''a Nonu for the game''s only try. To say Cooper was rattled would be an understatement.</p><p>It did not help that the Wallaby pack were getting precisely no change out of either the All Black front five or the referee, Craig Joubert. Weepu, having missed the conversion and hit a post with his first penalty attempt, located the target and Cruden, a skateboarding youth from Palmerston North, slid over a sweet drop goal to make the score 11-3. When Richard Kahui clattered the long‑suffering Cooper with a perfectly timed tackle, it was a neat summation of the first half.</p><p>Even Cooper''s drop goal seven minutes before the interval was swiftly cancelled out by a soft penalty the other way, the tireless James Horwill spilling the ball forward and into the arms of an offside colleague, Adam Ashley-Cooper. The half-time stats showed that Australia had enjoyed just 32% of the territory; by the end it was only 38%. They managed to beat South Africa on defensive bravery alone but an All Black pack in this sort of mood is a different proposition.</p><p>If you wanted to pick holes you could say that Dagg''s drop-goal technique needs a bit of work – he missed a hatful in the warm-up and sliced one horribly during the game. There is nothing wrong, though, with the All Black defence, nor their scrummaging. With eight minutes left, the&nbsp;Wallaby scrum splintered upwards again and Thorn emerged roaring and pumping the air. At that moment not a soul in the ground would have bet against New Zealand lifting the Webb Ellis Cup. The bookmakers'' odds are in the region&nbsp;of&nbsp;1‑9.</p><p>The rest was pure agony for the Australians, give or take a yellow card for&nbsp;Sonny Bill Williams, given for a dangerous tackle.</p><p>"Packing down at the last&nbsp;scrum, I looked at [the Wallaby scrum-half] Will Genia and he said, ''Well done,''" said McCaw with a grin, his injured foot apparently no longer an issue. "But we''re not going to get ahead of ourselves. All we''ve done is give ourselves a chance. We need to be the same, if not better, next&nbsp;week."</p><p>Nonu suffered a neck spasm but he will apparently be fine for the final. Cooper''s bruised pride may&nbsp;take a little longer to heal.

The band of the Royal Marines marched to a new composition, Wootton Bassett, written by director of music Captain Pete Curtis.</p><p>The town crier, Owen Collier, had a new uniform for the event, and the town''s own band, serving members of the forces and veterans, and local schoolchildren also took part.</p><p>The town''s special events over the weekend exemplified the mixture of the formal and the everyday, which made the tributes – originally a spontaneous gesture of respect by a handful of British Legion members – so touching.</p><p>As well as the speeches, the new road signs, the flag flown for the first time with the new coat of arms incorporating a golden lion – a symbol of England and royalty since medieval times – there was an exhibition at the library of gifts sent to the town from all over the world, a specially commissioned souvenir tea towel and a baking competition to create a new bun, The Bassett Crown.</p><p>The town''s recent place in history <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/31/wootton-bassett-final-repatriation-day?INTCMP=SRCH" title="">began in 2007</a>, when the bodies of fallen servicemen and women began to be repatriated through RAF Lyneham, because runway work was being carried out at Brize Norton. The then mayor, Percy Miles, learned by chance when he was in town shopping that the first cortege carrying a coffin would soon pass through the main the street en route to a hospital in Oxford. He rushed home to fetch his robes and then stood by the road, head bowed. He was quickly joined by shopkeepers and office workers.</p><p>The ceremony, never formally organised, was repeated 167 times, for the return of 345 bodies. It grew and grew: the church bell tolled, the flag was lowered, and soon families of the bereaved, along with many curious visitors, were travelling to join the townspeople, until thousands lined the streets each time, throwing flowers on to the passing cars, passing around paper tissues to mop streaming eyes.</p><p>The last repatriation was in August, of the body of 24-year-old Daniel Clack, killed by a roadside bomb in Helmand, Afghanistan. The repatriations are now back at Brize Norton.</p><p>Wootton Bassett sent the flag lowered on so many occasions to the nearest town to the new route, Carterton in Oxfordshire, where a memorial garden has been created.</p><p>The streets of Wootton Bassett will soon be quiet again and RAF Lyneham, which is to close with the loss of many jobs, even quieter.</p><p>The present mayor, Paul Heaphy  – who said: "We did not ask for recognition and we find the attention rather humbling" – announced that the town''s new motto would be "We honour those who serve".</p><p>He said: "The royal status is a privilege, yet it is received with sadness, mindful of the high price paid by our armed forces.</p><p>"I suspect that local people in the town will still call the town just Bassett."</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Military&k=Monarchy&k=UK+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Royal+Wootton+Bassett+celebrates+its+new+title+Article+1648325&ch=UK+news&c2=60753&c4=Military+UK%2CMonarchy%2CUK+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Maev+Kennedy&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648325&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2011/oct/16/royal-wootten-bassett-celebrites-title|2011-10-16T21:13:24+01:00|b80978696ed3d603195f313389eeb7bbcd701bcd -->', NULL, 'UK news', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:27'),

The event was so taboo it could have end with the bride and groom in jail.</p><p>"That day I felt like a freedom fighter, like liberty itself," says 28-year-old Noah of his Indonesian wedding, with the photograph album of last year''s ceremony spread open across his knees. "But the truth is, we have no choice but to keep it a secret."</p><p>"It" is the fact that Noah, a small-boned man with teenage acne, a gelled-back crew cut and wispy moustache, is not yet – in the eyes of his government – a man.</p><p>One of a growing number of Indonesia''s transgender people, Noah – who was born female, but is now pre-op female to male – is defying considerable sociocultural taboos in the world''s most populous Muslim country to become who he feels he is: "A man who just wants to be with the person I love."</p><p>"There''s no shortcut for this," he says, quietly, of his transgender life. "You have to plan everything – how to fit into society, how to act like a man, how to behave ''normally''. If you don''t, you face discrimination – and physical, sexual and verbal abuse."</p><p>There are no official figures for the number of transgender people currently living in Indonesia. "She-males" – or waria – are some of the most socially visible, with the most famous among them, talkshow host Dorce Gamalama, considered the Indonesian Oprah.</p><p>But the transgender life is not easy in Indonesia. While legally allowed to marry, they can do so only after successfully completing realignment surgery, a prohibitively expensive process which costs 200m rupiah (£14,300). They must also wait for a government-issued identity card declaring their new gender.</p><p>In a nation where the average annual income is 20m rupiah, (£1,430) many transgenders and their partners are forced instead to lead what are, technically, same-sex relationships.</p><p>"This is a grey area in Indonesian law," says Yuli Rustinawati of the Jakarta-based lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) charity Arus Pelangi (Rainbow Stream). "The national government recognises sex but not gender, or – in other words – the result of realignment surgery, but not the process."</p><p>While neither LGBT persons nor same-sex relations are prohibited by the Indonesian state of 240 million, 80% of whom are Muslim, local governments vary in how they handle it.</p><p>Many states, such as south Sumatra, use anti-prostitution laws to restrict the rights of LGBT people, where "prostitution" is widely defined to include homosexual sex and lesbianism, as well as pornography and sexual abuse. In the sharia state of Aceh, gay sex is punishable by jail, while waria, once nationally deemed cacat, or mentally ill, are now categorised along with the homeless as a "social welfare problem".</p><p>According to Sardjono Sigit, of Gaya Nusantara, an LGBT rights group based in Surabaya, east Java, such laws simply prove that "LGBT people in Indonesia are still regarded as freaks who are part of some ''special community''."</p><p>"As an ''entertainer'', an LGBT person can be free to express their sexuality as part of their ''performance''," he says. "But in daily life, they''re still expected to behave as heterosexuals."</p><p>LGBT rights have recently gained exposure thanks to the Indonesian human rights commission and a new, official network of HIV/Aids programmes. However – and possibly as a response to the nation''s exacting cultural mores – reports of unusual marriages such as Noah''s have surged in the past few months, from small villages in Aceh to the capital city of Jakarta.</p><p>Mainly involving seemingly heterosexual couples who are later found to contain a transgender partner, the stories have flummoxed locals and officials alike. The latest report, of two women who married as a heterosexual couple but were later exposed by neighbours to be lesbians, created a stir when the local religious police threatened to behead the women and set them alight as punishment for their "embarrassing and forbidden" behaviour.</p><p>While local rights groups concede that the Indonesian LGBT movement has gained considerable ground in the last five years, so too has the fundamental Islamic movement, says Rustinawati.</p><p>"Many communities now send LGBT people to pasantran (Islamic boarding schools) for ''sexual re-education''," she explains. "LGBT conferences have been cancelled and the Q! (queer) film festival was attacked by the Islamic Defenders Front — but the police don''t protect us, because they don''t want to get involved with the Islamicists." Last year''s attack on the festival — when masked people threatened to burn down participating cinemas — was supported by the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country''s highest religious body.</p><p>For Noah, who faced  abuse at school, was beaten with brooms and stones by his family, and twice tried to kill himself, the only way to live as a self-declared devout Muslim and transgender in Indonesia is to "have a strategy.</p><p>"You have to be careful with everything you do. I''ve moved house and changed jobs since starting the testosterone, and I have almost no friends. " In the bedsit she shares with her husband, Noah''s wife Dian, 28, confides that she, too, fears for her own life.

Lawrence allegedly allowed the Australia flanker David Pocock to get away with all sorts of illegalities at the breakdown in the quarter-final against the Springboks.</p><p>A South African referee, Craig Joubert, was less tolerant of Pocock''s penchant for slowing down opposition ball in the semi-final against New Zealand on Sunday night. The All Blacks'' kicker, Piri Weepu, twice found himself lining up penalties in the first 12 minutes, after the flanker had been penalised for going off his feet.</p><p>It was almost a replay of the opening minutes of New Zealand''s 2007 World Cup quarter-final against France, when Richie McCaw, who had been accused of cheating at the breakdown in the build‑up, was penalised twice and had to modify his&nbsp;approach.</p><p>The All Blacks knew on Sunday night that, like South Africa, they would have an advantage in the tight five. It was a matter of containing Pocock – their ploy was to force the flanker to make a tackle and then to clear out the ruck when he was still on the floor. Pocock was rarely able to slow down New Zealand''s ball and the Wallabies were on the back foot from the start. When they did earn some respite and made their way upfield, McCaw was penalised at a ruck and James O''Connor kicked the three points after Pocock had ruffled the hair of his opposite number.</p><p>"Keep your head, David, keep your head," said Joubert, but Australia were heading out. There had been speculation  that McCaw was struggling with a foot injury and that the semi-final would see him bequeath his title of master of the breakdown to Pocock. In the event the handover was postponed, as the New Zealand captain gave one of the performances of his distinguished career.</p><p>"We were not able to slow down their ball as much as we would have liked," said Pocock. "I do not want to comment on the&nbsp;referee. He did his best. I personally found it a very frustrating game, but we&nbsp;did not lose because of what happened at the breakdown. New Zealand were better than us on a night when they showed real quality."</p><p>Flankers in the mould of Pocock and McCaw test the tolerance of referees to the full, looking from the off to see what they will be able to get away with. It was a case of almost anything for Pocock against South Africa, but nowhere near as much against New Zealand.</p><p>"The breakdown is a big part of the game and it is something you have to deal with," said Pocock. "Some referees have taken a lot of flak in the media during the World Cup, but in fairness to them I think they have done a good job across the board. They have been pretty consistent."</p><p>The New Zealand coach, Graham Henry, said the All Blacks had devised a plan to contain Pocock and the blindside Jerome Kaino, who rarely wasted an opportunity to give the 23-year old his advice, said the neutralisation of the Wallaby was a reason that a night that had been expected to be tight and tense was almost stress-free.</p><p>"Pocock was the man in their pack we knew we had to contain," said Kaino. "We made sure that we ran at him at every opportunity and it paid off. We kept him away from our ball for a lot of the time and it allowed us to play at our own pace."</p><p>So the hosts of 2007 will meet the hosts of 2011 in Sunday''s final. It looks safe to assume that there will be no repeat of the All Blacks'' complaints about the refereeing in Cardiff four years ago when, despite constant pressure in the second-half, they were not awarded one penalty.</p><p>Here, it was not until the 76th minute, when Sonny Bill Williams was sent to the sin-bin, that Australia won a penalty in the&nbsp;second-half. Hosts often get a good break from referees – good news for England in 2015.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=Rugby+World+Cup+2011&k=Australia+rugby+union+team&k=New+Zealand+rugby+union+team&k=Rugby+union&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%3A+All+Blacks+succeed+in+plot+to+stop+David+Pocock+Article+1648370&ch=Sport&c2=60753&c4=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%2CAustralia+rugby+union+team%2CNew+Zealand+rugby+union+team%2CRugby+union%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Paul+Rees+at+Eden+Park&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648370&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2011/oct/16/rugby-world-cup-david-pocock|2011-10-16T21:13:26+01:00|c9bad754bed4c52688720857745e557accde725f -->', NULL, 'Sport', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:29'),

I remember as a 15-year-old watching the first broadcast of <a href="http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/feature-project/pages/Forgotten-Silver.php" title="www.filmarchive.org.nz: Forgotten Silver">Peter Jackson''s Forgotten Silver</a> on New Zealand television and being completely taken in (having few critical faculties at such a tender age) – as was a large percentage of the country''s population, one viewer even writing to the New Zealand Listener claiming to have discovered a historical link to the mocumentary''s protagonist, the fictional film pioneer Colin McKenzie. Of course there have been many similar hoaxes, the <a href="http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/warofworlds.htm" title="history1900s.about.com: War of the Worlds Radio Broadcast Causes Panic">Orson Welles War of the Worlds radio broadcast</a> springs to mind, and recently <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/oct/14/nat-tate-artist-hoax-william-boyd?newsfeed=true" title="guardian: Nat Tate: my part in his art">William Boyd discussed his invented artist Nat Tate</a>. We might deem these "celebrated hoaxes", as sometimes it''s entertaining for the perpetrator, the victim and the observer, but not always.</p><p>I suppose one could claim a distinction between hoax and fraud as the subversion of systems and institutions v deceit for financial (even emotional) gain — though I''m not even certain the two can be separated so distinctly. The agenda and vehicle of a hoax often take the form of parody and satire.</p><p>In January 2006 a friend and I exchanged a number of amusing emails that resulted in the invention of a new art movement we called <a href="http://canalettoscornershop.blogspot.com/2006/09/metadadaism.html" title="canalettoscornershop.blogspot.com: metadadaism ">metadadaism</a>. Intended as affectionate satire on contemporary art, at the core of metadadaism was a fictional exhibition titled Nothing — an empty art gallery.</p><p>We added metadadaism to Wikipedia, where it remained for a number of years unchallenged, additionally picked up by various other encyclopaedic websites. To our amusement, later that year an exhibition titled Gallery Space Recall – an empty gallery – took place at the Chapel Arts Centre in Wales. Although I may fantasise about it being the first metadadaist exhibition, any concrete link is surely spurious: an empty gallery was obvious evolution for the art world.</p><p>Of course William Boyd was not the first to invent an artist complete with biography and art works – there are hundreds of examples, the motives of which could perhaps be deemed as pseudonym, alter ego, propaganda, satire, homage, fraud and others. Many artists were and are tied to exclusivity agreements with art galleries and sign works with a pseudonym in order to earn extra revenue on the side; others have used pseudonyms to create distinction between their primary "creative" artworks and those that pandered to say a "tourist" market.</p><p>Marcel Duchamp used alter ego in the guises of R. Mutt and Rrose Sélavy for purposes of subversion, humour and critique. I''m unsure what the motives were for the Spanish/Mexican writer Max Aub who invented Jusep Torres Campalans, perhaps a number of the above, but the fictitious artist is in most cases allied to a celebrated master (Campalans was associated with Picasso) as well as historic events (Colin McKenzie at Gallipoli and the Spanish civil war); by these associations the fictitious artist is seeded in reality and gains kudos.</p><p>One invented artist I''m certain falls into the category of fraud is <a href="http://arthistory.about.com/b/2008/08/10/who-on-earth-was-pietro-psaier.htm" title="arthistory.about.com: Who on Earth Was Pietro Psaier?">Pietro Psaier</a>. Apparently Psaier lived some kind of global traveller''s existence; according to various biographies he originated in Italy, later living in Spain, the US and lastly Sri Lanka, where he "died" in the tsunami. Psaier conveniently collaborated with famed artists such as Andy Warhol, Mel Ramos, <a href="http://www.acfineartsite.com/RJS.html" title="">Rupert Jasen Smith</a>, John Lennon, hobnobbed with celebrities, and must have spent a fortune lugging around the thousands of artworks he never exhibited, as well as all the essential printing equipment.</p><p>Psaier artworks started appearing on the market in the late 1990s and have been sold at every major UK auction house, most provincial auction rooms, and others across the globe. Not just a few either: by my estimation approximately 5,000 Psaier works have been sold in the past 10 or so years, ranging in price from £50 to £14,000 – easily well over a million pounds'' worth.</p><p>You could view Psaier as altar ego, in the same way as Aub''s Campalans or Boyd''s  Tate, but the absence of an "in joke", or indeed any joke or agenda apart from intent to defraud monies by deception, is for me a vital distinction. As with Forgotten Silver and Tate, people have claimed to have known Psaier, including Uri Geller (who later backtracked) as well as the Madrid-based psychiatrist <a href="http://www.pietropsaierartist.com/interview_with_dr_ca.html" title="www.pietropsaierartist.com: In Search of Psaier">Carlos Langelaan Alvarez</a>.</p><p>At least six Psaier works were marketed as collaborations with Mel Ramos – these works were copies of Ramos works and signed with both artists'' signatures. Ramos himself told me they were (and I quote) "knock-offs" and that he''d never heard of Psaier. As yet there have been no investigations and the work still appears regularly in auction houses. (Don''t even get me started on the ethics of some auctioneers.)</p><p>The naivety of the art world is oft exposed and curiously celebrated, with hoaxers and fraudsters gaining the celebrated status of the anti-hero, perceptively beating the establishment at its own game. I can take pleasure from a good hoax, but more sinister applications leave you contemptuous, resentful and out of pocket. I''m not exactly sure where the line is, but there must be one, surely? As for the people who claim to know these fictitious characters: well, some people apparently talk to aliens, others to God.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Art&k=Art+and+design&k=Art+markets&k=Culture&k=Crime&k=UK+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=If+you+want+to+distinguish+art%27s+hoaxes+from+its+frauds%2C+ask+a+metadadaist+%7C+Tim+Williams+Article+1648408&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=60753&c4=Art+%28visual+arts+only%29%2CArt+and+design%2CArt+markets%2CCulture%2CCrime+-+UK+%28News%29%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CWilliam+Boyd+%28author%29%2CBooks&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Tim+Williams&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648408&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2011/oct/16/art-hoaxes-frauds-metadadaist|2011-10-16T21:13:26+01:00|89f4f7bfaf2932618d62d22d4fc5b083fd615d04 -->', NULL, 'Comment is free', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:29'),

He was also one of the few solo singers to have Bob Marley''s harmony vocals grace his work.</p><p>Born in Boundbrook, a small community on the outskirts of the northern coastal town of Port Antonio, Dillon was raised mostly by his Seventh Day Adventist grandparents. Since his grandfather was the choirmaster in the church, and his mother gave private music lessons, it seems the family was musically inclined, and Dillon soon heeded his calling; while still attending high school in Port Antonio, he performed with a local band called the Playboys (later known as Ray and the Gladiators), the melodic quality of his voice earning him the moniker Sparrow.</p><p>At the age of 18, Dillon moved to the Jamaican capital, Kingston, in search of employment, lodging in a minute dwelling in the western slum of Back-O-Wall. In 1963, he travelled to Florida to undertake seasonal farm work, and upon returning to Jamaica the following year met Peter Tosh, one of the Wailers, who took note of Dillon''s obvious talent.</p><p>Tosh introduced Dillon to his bandmates, Marley and Bunny Wailer, and an audition was arranged for Dillon at Studio One. The resultant recording session yielded four songs, with Dillon credited as "Jack Sparrow". On three of these, including the underground favourite Ice Water, he was backed by the Wailers; the fourth, Woman Wine and Money, was harmonised by Delroy Wilson.</p><p>As the Wailers were too focused on their own careers to provide much further assistance, Dillon soon decided to form his own harmony group with Stephen Taylor and Aston Morrison, aspiring singers he met while working as a mason. They returned to Studio One, where its founder, Clement Dodd, christened the group the Ethiopians. They quickly cut four songs, including the popular I''m Gonna Take Over Now, but a lack of ready finance caused Morrison to quit.</p><p>Dillon and Taylor found a financial backer in the building contractor  Leebert Robinson. Their self-produced singles Train to Skaville, The Whip and Cool It Amigo were all sizable hits in 1967, and the duo undertook a UK tour the following year, after Train to Skaville inched into the top 40. Upon returning to Jamaica, the group temporarily added Melvin Reid to their ranks for a handful of recordings for Federal Records. Then, a duo again, they scored a huge hit with Engine 54, working with the Trinidadian immigrant Garnet Hargreaves.</p><p>Their most solid partnership was forged with the producer Carl "Sir JJ" Johnson, and yielded a series of hits in 1969-70, including Feel the Spirit, Woman Capture Man, Hong Kong Flu and Everything Crash (the latter two songs recorded with the noted session band the Caribbeats). Further work for producers such as Alvin Ranglin and Derrick Harriott evidenced a high standard, as did collaborations with Lee "Scratch" Perry, whose Black Ark studio Dillon helped to construct in 1973.</p><p>After the death of Taylor in a road accident in 1975, Dillon formed a new version of the Ethiopians for the 1977 album Slave Call. Thereafter he recorded only sporadically, as a solo artist. His late 1970s material for Studio One was particularly noteworthy, while his 1986 album Dread Prophecy, backed by the Gladiators band, and issued by the US-based Nighthawk label, was also above average.</p><p>He is survived by seven children, seven grandchildren, two brothers and a sister.</p><p>• Leonard Dillon, singer and songwriter, born 9 December 1942; died 28 September 2011</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Reggae&k=Urban+music&k=Music&k=Pop+and+rock&k=Jamaica&k=Bob+Marley" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Leonard+Dillon+obituary+Article+1648385&ch=Music&c2=60753&c4=Reggae+%28music+genre%29%2CUrban+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CJamaica+%28News%29%2CBob+Marley&c3=The+Guardian&c6=David+Katz&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648385&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2011/oct/16/leonard-dillon-obituary|2011-10-16T21:13:26+01:00|9fb51808d2bf830b70ea841ab8b6a616c3455b0d -->', NULL, 'Music', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:29'),

Though the woman miscarried after three months, it was a huge medical breakthrough and paved the way for Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards''s successful test-tube baby five years later in Britain.</p><p>Wood and his team produced Australia''s first test-tube baby, Candice Reed, in 1980 by using Steptoe and Edwards''s technique of collecting an egg just before natural ovulation. In 1983, they established the world''s first pregnancy from a frozen embryo; the baby, Zoe, was born in April 1984 to a couple with a seven-year history of infertility.</p><p>Also in 1983 they performed the first human donor egg transplant, having perfected the technique in ewes. After giving fertility treatment to a 42-year-old woman and returning four embryos back into her they had one surplus, which, with the donor''s agreement, was implanted into an infertile woman aged 38. None of the embryos implanted themselves in the 42-year-old, but the one in the other recipient did, only to miscarry at three months. They successfully implanted another donor-egg embryo shortly afterwards into a woman aged 29 who had suffered a premature menopause.</p><p>The first attempt was criticised by Steptoe and Edwards in the British Medical Journal. They were particularly concerned about the use of eggs from older donors and suggested that hurried decisions had been taken under pressure. Wood''s team defended their action, saying that both donor and recipient were aware of the risks, particularly of a baby with Down''s syndrome being born.</p><p>With Alan Trounson and a gynaecologist colleague, John Leeton, Wood was a world pioneer of using fertility drugs for producing multiple eggs, which could then be frozen. This revolutionised the IVF success rate. The technique enabled would-be mothers to undergo fewer operations to recover eggs and, as some eggs could be safely reserved for future use, reduced the risk of multiple pregnancies.</p><p>Producing and freezing multiple eggs is now a standard technique and has produced more than 5 million IVF babies worldwide. The technique was in its infancy when used for baby Zoe; 10 eggs were fertilised and three transplanted back into the mother. As no pregnancy resulted but six of the remaining seven remaining embryos were developing normally, they were frozen. At a second attempt, three embryos were transferred to the mother and one, Zoe, attached itself to the uterus lining. There were further complications –  hormone deficiency, an ovarian cyst and placental complications – during the pregnancy. Zoe was born prematurely by caesarean section, but was healthy and started breastfeeding immediately.</p><p>In 1986 Wood''s team was responsible for the world''s first IVF baby using sperm retrieval surgery, and in 1992 the world''s first microinjection intrafallopian transfer IVF baby.</p><p>Wood was born in Melbourne, the son of a respected gynaecologist. He shone at Wesley college and Melbourne University, graduating in 1952, and was also a champion athlete. He decided early in his career that he wanted to make gynaecological procedures less unpleasant for women. After four years'' graduate training at the Alfred and Women''s hospitals in Melbourne, he spent eight years in London, doing postgraduate research at the Royal Veterinary college while working and teaching at Queen Charlotte''s hospital, where he co-founded the Blair Bell society for research in human reproduction. During this time he took a few months'' leave to research at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. In 1964 he was headhunted to found a new chair in obstetrics and gynaecology back in Melbourne.</p><p>In 1971 he appointed embryologists Trounson and Alex Lopata to start a programme of human IVF at Melbourne''s Queen Victoria hospital. With only two new patients a week and wanting more, in 1972 Wood linked up with the Royal Women''s hospital in nearby Parkville, where Dr Ian Johnston, newly returned from a fertility conference, shared his enthusiasm for starting IVF. Together with Professor David de Kretser, the governor of Victoria until April this year, they enabled that first test-tube pregnancy, which ended in miscarriage.</p><p>After the birth of Louise Brown, the first "test-tube baby", Steptoe was invited to lecture in Melbourne. He gave no details about his technique but invited Trounson and Lopata to further lectures in London, where, said Lopata, the relevant information was again withheld. However, Edwards did reveal the importance, as a first step, of working with women with helpful natural menstrual cycles. Professor Ian Craft of the Royal Free hospital, London, had also failed to get information from Steptoe and Edwards, and in 1979 went to Melbourne, where he watched the embryo transfer that resulted in Candice Reed''s birth. Fertility specialists from around the world visited Melbourne to learn the techniques.</p><p>Wood made other major research contributions to gynaecology, previously the Cinderella of medical research, adding to knowledge of uterine contractibility, the psychological effects of hysterectomy, and the corpus luteum''s role in ovulation and pregnancy. He introduced fetal monitoring, pioneered psychosocial obstetrics, and established clinics for endometriosis and contraception. Other work included improving surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy and microsurgical repair of damaged fallopian tubes. The Australian government gave Wood no research grants and he funded his work from the US Ford Foundation and his private practice.</p><p>The techniques used in Zoe''s conception were greeted without enthusiasm in Britain: Dr Clive Froggatt of the Royal College of General Practitioners described the advance as extremely worrying, and said that it was impossible to guarantee the safety of such an experiment: "even if this pregnancy is safely brought to term, there is still no way to ensure that another would be". The College told an inquiry chaired by Mary Warnock (now Baroness Warnock) that freezing embryos was unethical. The Royal College of Nursing also took the position that freezing both eggs and sperm was unethical.</p><p>Patients and colleagues alike found Wood to be "the nicest man you could wish to meet". Although he transparently enjoyed his fame, he was not motivated by it; his one wish was to make life better for his patients. His techniques were originally regarded as highly controversial in the early days and met with condemnation and accusations that he was "playing god". Annie Dixon, who became Australia''s third test-tube mother in 1981, had to run the gauntlet of protesters who shouted and spat at her outside Wood''s clinic. In 1982 the Victoria legislature temporarily  suspended all IVF work.</p><p>Charming, good-humoured, unconventional and creative, Wood had a holistic approach to gynaecology. When teaching students to do pelvic examinations, he employed professional models who were relaxed about it, and this in turn made the students more relaxed and more sympathetic to patients. He introduced ethics committees to Monash University in Melbourne in the 1970s and encouraged the formation of patient advocacy groups. A workaholic, he taught IVF techniques to gynaecologists from around the world. He published 400 research papers and 23 popular and technical books. He backed legalisation of abortion and supported a colleague''s gender-reassignment clinic.</p><p>Wood, who never sought recognition or high office for his ideas or achievements, was appointed CBE in 1982 and was made a companion of the Order of Australia in 1995.</p><p>Wood married Judith, a nursing colleague, in 1957. They divorced in 1987 at the height of his celebrity. His second marriage, to Marie, ended in divorce in 2000. Two years later, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer''s disease, he moved back to live with Judith. She survives him, along with their two sons and a daughter.</p><p>• Carl (Edwin Carlyle) Wood, gynaecologist, born 28 May 1929; died 23 September 2011</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/science&k=Medical+research&k=Fertility+problems&k=Medicine&k=Society&k=Science&k=Reproduction" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Carl+Wood+obituary+Article+1648390&ch=Science&c2=60753&c4=Medical+research+%28Science%29%2CFertility+problems+%28Society%29%2CMedicine+%28Education+subject%29%2CSociety%2CScience%2CReproduction%2CAustralia+%28News%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Caroline+Richmond&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648390&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: science/2011/oct/16/carl-wood-obituary|2011-10-16T21:13:26+01:00|907fe84375aa2dae0282e51876de2b3d5b177d9c -->', NULL, 'Science', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:29'),

They all assumed they were the next Arsene Wenger basically, or maybe Steve McClaren, and their names were tentatively floated when big jobs became available. Some were even regarded as future England managers. Anyway, to cut a long story short, they either now manage on the lower leagues, or can now be seen on Gillette Soccer Specials, but usually on midweek Carling Cup nights, never on Saturday afternoons. But there''s one man of that genre who has avoided that grim fate, though there were a few rocky spells, not least when he was sacked by Southampton a year ago. Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, please give it up for Alan Pardew! </p><p>Initially seen as another part of the Cockney Mafia on Tyneside, Pardew has been carefully rehabilitating his reputation at Newcastle, who are unbeaten and sitting as pretty as bare-chested, pot-bellied Geordies in fourth place. It''s quite a comeback for a side who were relegated to the Championship in 2009 and a manager who was in League One two years ago and unemployed this time last year. Still, a certain amount of caution remains about Newcastle, who are yet to <em>really</em> play anyone of any significance yet. We can discount the draw they got against Arsenal on the first day of the season because, well, just look at them. There have been impressive performances - winning at Sunderland and Wolves for example - but no opposition to truly test them just yet. </p><p>That changes this afternoon. Tottenham have already failed two tests, getting stuffed by the Manchester clubs, and subsequently passed another two, beating Liverpool and Arsenal (and yes, I ruled them out in Newcastle''s case, but north London derbies are different). This promises to be a cracking encounter: Yohan Cabaye v Luka Modric, Scott Parker v Cheik Tiote and Demba Ba v Emmanuel Adebayor. We essentially already know about Tottenham - there''s nothing really left to <em>learn</em> about them - but by 6pm, we could know a lot more about where Newcastle''s season is heading.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>Do Newcastle''s fans use this chant for Demba Ba?</strong> If not, it''s a dereliction of duty.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>Here are today''s teams.</strong> Adebayor does start for Spurs, with Jermain Defore replaced by Jake Livermore.</p><p><strong>Newcastle (4-4-2):</strong> Krul; Simpson, Steven Taylor, Coloccini, Ryan Taylor; Obertan, Cabaye, Tiote, Gutierrez; Best, Ba. <strong>Subs:</strong> Elliot, Santon, Ben Arfa, Lovenkrands, Gosling, Marveaux, Shola Ameobi.</p><p><strong>Tottenham (4-4-1-1): </strong>Friedel; Walker, Kaboul, King, Assou-Ekotto;<br />Livermore, Parker, Modric, Bale; Van der Vaart; Adebayor. <strong>Subs:</strong> Cudicini, Pavlyuchenko, Giovani, Defoe, Bassong, Rose, Townsend.</p><p>Referee: Lee Probert (Wiltshire)</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>Oliver Lewis emails.</strong> "Oddly looking forward to this one as a Toon fan, first game where all in all no disaster to drop all 3 points so pressure kinda off and lets have a good game," he says. "Disappointing on teams I hear though, no room for Santon in first team or HBA. Disagree with Pardew''s idea of never changing a winning team, instead should be looking to constantly improve. Santon, Marveaux and Ben Arfa would all make this squad better, when better to give them a proper run out than in a game with less to lose? Would have been nice to start at least once. Come second half though we have strong players coming off the bench."</p><p><strong>Ade Cooper''s also here.</strong> "I''d quite to like to hear Newcastle fans doing a Demba Ba chant to the tune of the Beach Boys'' <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbMqRO6lnc">Barbara Ann</a>," he says. I think you meant Barber Ran.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>Before we get going, enjoy this piece of retro-Premier League action, when Newcastle beat Tottenham 7-1 here back in December 1996.</strong> Kevin Keegan left not long after.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>Harry Redknapp''s talking, which is never interesting.</strong> "Twenty pints of Guinness please, mate. Every time Demba Ba has scored for West Ham or Newcastle and I''ve heard a commentator blurt out his name, I always think they''re having a momentary flashback to a stag weekend in Dublin," notes Alan Pollock. "Yours on the puke-flecked cobbles of that very same fair city." I don''t think I''ve ever got through a pint of Guinness.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>The teams are out.</strong> They''ll have to line up next to each other and listen to some music next. Then they can play football.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>Peep!</strong> And off we go, Newcastle kicking off in the traditional style and attacking from right to left. They''re in their black and white stripes; Tottenham look like Fiorentina, who drew 0-0 with Cesena earlier. Let''s hope that''s not an omen. Interestingly Bale has started on the right for Spurs.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>2 min:</strong> The early signs are that this is a match that will be played with the very best intentions. Gutierrez threads a glorious eye-of-the-needle pass through to Obertan on the left, but the ball gets stuck under his feet and Walker, who had fallen asleep initially, recovers.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>3 min:</strong> There are going to be chances in this game. Adebayor dummies Assou-Ekotto''s pass inside from the left, the ball reaching Van der Vaart on the edge of the area. His touch forward is just too heavy though and Ryan Taylor gets across to Peter Kay the ball into the stands.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>4 min:</strong> "I had no idea this was an international match," toots Ian Copestake. "Is the music they are listening to to mark an official north south divide?" That''s only happening now?</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>5 min:</strong> Parker is penalised for what appeared to be a fair challenge on his old West Ham pal Demba Ba in the middle of Tottenham''s half. Ryan Taylor finds Steven Taylor, who takes the novel step of doing Tottenham''s work for them by generously clearing the ball with a bullet header. If that had been on target, it definitely would have gone in - however he was facing away from goal and managed to direct it towards the centre circle. But still, the technique was great. If you like your headers meaty, you''ll have enjoyed that.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>8 min:</strong> Kaboul knocks a searching pass forward for Adebayor to take on Steven Taylor, who does brilliantly to stand up to the striker''s strength, hold him off and avert a possible opening for Spurs.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>9 min:</strong> Van der Vaart and Modric mess up a short-corner routine between them. Do these things ever work? Just get it in the mixer.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>10 min:</strong> Parker has a prodded pop from 25 yards out. There was no threat to it, but it took a nick on its way through, meaning the jeers from the Newcastle fans are ill-judged. Another corner to Spurs then, but Kaboul''s header from deep inside the area is easily collected by Krul. Tottenham are the better side here, zipping the ball about confidently and attacking with some menace.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>12 min:</strong> Walker goes in a fraction late on Ryan Taylor on the left, giving the Newcastle left-back another chance to put a cross into the Tottenham area. Taylor swings a dangerous ball into the corridor of uncertainty, as it were, but Friedel keeps his eyes on it and remains unflustered by Obertan''s attempt to get a toe on the cross.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>15 min:</strong> If Best had been switched on here, he would have been through. Ba tried to slide him in, but King half-cut the pass out. However he didn''t get enough on it, the ball bobbling through anyway, but Best had assumed the chance had gone and was standing in a daydream, much to the chagrin of Newcastle''s fans. "Do short corners work?" asks Joe Mahoney. "Ask Barcelona." They play a different sport.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>16 min:</strong> Gareth Bale is limping. Maybe he just wants to go back to the left wing.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>18 min:</strong> Neither keeper has had to make a save yet. Please not one of <em>those</em> games with lots of cleared crosses.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>19 min:</strong> "What was song Ian Copestake on about?" says Mark Guthrie. "Surely he''s not so London-centric that he has never heard The Balydon Races before? Unless he thinks that Blitzkrieg Bop is the national anthem of the North East? On another matter, While Redknapp is hardly known as a tactical master, putting Bale up against the dodgy at best Ryan Taylor is going to cause problems to Newcastle at only Alan Pardew couldn''t have anticipated. I''m telling you now, that''s where the goals are going to come from." I''m not so sure. Bale is very transparent, it''s obvious he''s only ever going to go inside on to his left foot. If you can squeeze him, he''ll be restricted.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>21 min:</strong> A lot of ineffectual passing in midfield so far, followed by moves that break down at the very last. "If it''s into the mixer corner you crave then there are sneaky ways of delivering them, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjxuHlK61yM">this set of clips demonstrates</a>," says Ian Copestake. "Better with the sound off unless you like your football clips enhanced by eurotrash anthems."</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>22 min:</strong> Cabaye sprays a great pass out to Obertan on the right to isolate Assou-Ekotto, but the Frenchman''s low centre is put behind by King for a corner.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>23 min:</strong> The corner is a flagrant waste, Cabaye trying to work a Beckham-Scholes routine with a Newcastle player on the edge of the box. It''s headed away. JUST GET IT IN THE MIXER SON.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>24 min:</strong> A save for Friedel, if you can call it. Ba rises highest to meet a cross from the left at the far post, but he can''t generate any power on it and it''s straight at Friedel. Hellboy snaffles it with ease.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>26 min:</strong> I don''t want to seem ungrateful, but this is getting ominously close to dull. Let''s see Ian Ayre try and sell this to Asia.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>27 min:</strong> "Re Bale I agree wholeheartedly with you, but I think you are possibly overestemating Raylor''s ability to squeeze," says Mark Guthrie. "Oh, and is it just me and Ian Copestake watching the match? Is Gary Naylor on holiday?" Naylor was on the Arsenal-Sunderland mbm, using big words like "ameliorate" apparently.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>29 min:</strong> Ba and Gutierrez mess up a Newcastle attack. Walker defends well. I''ll just repeat this another 60 times, although the names and teams are interchangeable.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>30 min:</strong> A desperately sad sight here: Ledley King''s knee (I''m guessing) has flared up and he''s been replaced by Sebastien Bassong, who''s booed on to the pitch. It''s said often, but just how many England caps would King have had if he had working knees? He is brilliant.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>32 min:</strong> King had placed both Ba and Best snugly in his back-pocket. Bassong and Kaboul suddenly seems a much less secure pairing, with much more potential for farce.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>33 min:</strong> Apparently Pardew called this a "watershed" game for Newcastle. Now there''s a man who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx94jwmMxPs">knows a thing or two about the watershed</a>.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>34 min:</strong> As this game is offering us nothing to talk about, let''s turn to events elsewhere. "As a WBA fan may I once again extend thanks to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their gracious yearly gift of three points," says Adam Timmins. "Don''t know what we''d do without them!" You didn''t beat them in either game last season.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>35 min:</strong> Do you want to hear about a Newcastle corner that was headed away at the near post? Is that really what you want? "I am very angry with you, Jacob," says Ian Copestake. "By mentioning Hellboy my brain is immediately distracted by thoughts of Selma Blair. A period of calm reflection is now required to recover."</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>38 min:</strong> Modric and Van der Vaart have around three touches of the ball between them. Saying that, the former very nearly slipped Adebayor in with a clever reverse-pass, but a sliding Coloccini just cut it out.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>39 min:</strong> Tottenham have a penalty! And it is as clear as they come, as Steven Taylor bizarrely decides to tackle Adebayor with his ''wrong'' foot in the area and brings him down. Lee Probert takes an age to decide, but after an eternity he points to the spot.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>GOAL! Newcastle 0-1 Tottenham (Van der Vaart pen, 40 min):</strong> That''s an expertly taken penalty. Van der Vaart wraps his left foot around the ball and whips it into the right corner, Krul going the wrong way and Newcastle''s unbeaten record is under threat now. Newcastle aren''t happy, but it was a clear penalty. Steven Taylor was booked for the foul as Adebayor was going away from goal.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>42 min:</strong> Newcastle look to hit back immediately but Ba can only send an awkward header well over from Cabaye''s corner. As for the penalty, it was such a stupid challenge from Steven Taylor. His body shape was all wrong, he put his left leg forward when he should have used his right, and as Adebayor nicked the ball ahead of him, it was only ever going to be a clumsy foul.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>43 min:</strong> Newcastle''s fans are nursing a burning sense of injustice and are booing Adebayor. It was a very uncontroversial decision though.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>45 min:</strong> "I don''t think King would have won many more caps had he been injury free, because England''s Brave John Terry and Rio Ferdinand stood in his way, the two best defenders in world history according to Sky (and they''re never wrong)," says Jon Allison. "Not unless the midfield was to become even more of a square peg/round hole bodge with King, Lampard and Gerrard in the same team." King''s better than Terry. There, I said it.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>45 min+1: </strong>"Hawrite Jacob!" says Ryan Dunne. "Am sure that readers of the day''s other MBMs are, like me, itching to know: did you find out who nicked your iPod? Hope it didn''t have lots of embarrassing stuff on it. NB Hellboy is pish, you guys should go read some Cerebus." I don''t know who did. Embarrassing stuff? Will episodes of Football Weekly cover it?</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>Peep! Peep! </strong> Boos greet the half-time whistle from the Newcastle fans, who are booing for the sake of booing. Lee Probert has had an excellent half.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>Half time: Newcastle 0-1 Tottenham.</strong></p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>46 min:</strong> And we''re back. Some early head tennis in the Tottenham area shows us why this is the best league in the world. "Ledley King?" says Harvey Kelly. "Best English defender in living memory if you ask me. And no, I''m not a Tottenham supporter. Imagine if he could train, let alone train with his team-mates, we''d have a Baresi or a Beckenbauer on our hands." Rio Ferdinand is and was better.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>GOAL! Newcastle 1-1 Tottenham (Ba, 48 min):</strong> This is a brilliant response from Newcastle and they''ve shown us what they''re made of. They''d been far too tentative in attack until now, but suddenly Gutierrez took the game by the scruff of the neck, driving forward from the left. He jinked past a feeble non-challenge from Modric, burst past Walker and hang up a teasing cross that was met on the volley by the onrushing, sliding Ba from close range. He only directed it straight at Friedel, but luckily the Tottenham goalkeeper''s momentum was such that he ended up bundling the ball over the line with him. Is that an own goal then?</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>49 min:</strong> After the goal, there was some pushing and shoving between Cabaye and Livermore. Something about nothing. "Is Selma Blair in Cerebus?" asks Ian Copestake, for whom the restraining order is in the post.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>51 min:</strong> Adebayor is being booed for being fouled. "An Asian footy fan here," says Kamto Wong. "The game might be a bit dull, but I''d rather watch this game then the Manyoo/Chelsea/Real/Barca etc one-sided "bore-fest" they try to force down our neck every weekend." Do you hear, Ian Ayre? <strong>Do you hear</strong>?</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>52 min:</strong> Adebayor goes so close to restoring Tottenham''s lead within a matter of minutes. The chance came from exceptional play from Modric, who ghosted through midfield and then scooped a superb pass in between the two Taylors for Adebayor, who had stayed onside. His first touch took him away from goal, but from an angle on the right, his shot went through Steven Taylor''s legs and slithered just past the far post with Krul rooted to the spot.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>54 min:</strong> We''ve got a game on our hands now and not before time.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>55 min:</strong> "Well done Besty," shouts Pardew. "Superb." I can''t recall Best touching the ball.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>56 min:</strong> Bassong''s clearing header only finds Obertan around 30 yards from goal. He comes inside and then sends a low, swerving effort a few yards wide of Friedel''s left post.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>58 min:</strong> Lee Probert is the most unpopular man in Newcastle right now. Ryan Taylor stops playing on the left flank, assuming the ball had gone out for a throw-in - it had, but play to the whistle - and Modric skips past him, marauds into the area, bides his time and then cuts the ball back to Van der Vaart, who stabs a shot straight at Krul. More boos, more anger. And this time they have a point, although it was the <del>assistant referee''s</del> linesman''s fault.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>60 min:</strong> "No more boos for the ref from Newcastle fans I hope since he managed to dispossess Spurs in the build up to that goal," sighs Sam Abrahams.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>61 min:</strong> Kyle Walker could be the second Spurs player to go off injured. "He''s certainly a walker at the moment, not a runner," honks Martin Tyler. That''s quite a good one actually.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>63 min:</strong> It''s that time of the day: Rafael van der Vaart is going to be replaced by Jermain Defoe. Has he ever finished a game for Spurs?</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>65 min:</strong> Tottenham''s midfield does lack balance without Aaron Lennon and they don''t really have a replacement for him.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>GOAL! Newcastle 1-2 Tottenham (Defoe, 68 min):</strong> Well he didn''t need long. Just after Krul had denied Defoe a goal with his first touch by beating him to Parker''s defence-splitting pass, he puts Tottenham ahead with his next touch. This time Parker did find him with a pass from the left. He was outside the area and had his back to goal, but with Ryan Taylor caught on the wrong side of him, Defoe was able to spin in one movement and then crack a brilliant low shot into the bottom-right corner with his lesser-used left foot. That all happened in a flash. He''s so sharp.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>70 min:</strong> Modric lobs a pass over the top for Defoe, who looked offside. The flag stays down, but from a tight angle he can only whack a harmless shot into the side netting. Newcastle respond with two changes. Hatem Ben Arfa and Shola Ameobi are on, Demba Ba and Leon Best are off.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>72 min: </strong>Here he is. "I''ve been at the theatre and now must use some different big words in a review," says Gary Naylor. Get you. "It is Selma and not Tony with whom Mr Copestake is so taken isn''t it?"</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>73 min:</strong> Bale chips a cross towards Adebayor, who looks poised to head home and seal the game, only for Coloccini to lean in and knock him over. That could easily have been another penalty. The ball comes to Modric on the right goal-line, but it''s too tight for him to work another opening and Newcastle survive.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>75 min:</strong> Scott Parker is booked for fouling Ameobi on the right. It wasn''t a bad foul, but he''s been a persistent offender.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>76 min:</strong> "It''s not bad watching this match as text," says Oliver Mallah. That''s the high standard we try to achieve: not bad. "But every now and then, when I refresh it on my phone I get relegated to the past. It reverts to several minutes before." If you''re a Newcastle fan, that could be a good thing. Ah, for the bliss of before the 68th minute.</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>77 min:</strong> Newcastle throw on Davide Santon for Danny Simpson, a like-for-like swap.</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><strong>78 min:</strong> Tiote wallops Modric with a Rooney of a challenge. He''s booked, which is probably just about right.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>79 min:</strong> Walker goes for the spectacular with a volley from miles out. No.</p><!-- Block 64 --><p><strong>80 min:</strong> Ben Arfa finds a pocket of space for the first time and tees up Obertan for a cross from the right, but his low centre is too close to Friedel.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>81 min:</strong> Tiote tries a first-time curler from 25 yards out, but although it''s cleanly hit, it''s right above Friedel, who pushes over for a corner, which is headed away.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><strong>82 min:</strong> Newcastle are doing everything they can to find an equaliser. They now have a free-kick just outside the Spurs area after Parker''s foul on Tiote...</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>83 min:</strong> It looked like it was made for the left foot of Ben Arfa. Instead Ryan Taylor takes it with his right and curls it around the wall, only for Friedel to beat it aside at his near post.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>84 min:</strong> Clownish play from Adebayor stops Spurs from wrapping the game up. After a Tottenham break, he picked up possession on the edge of the area. He had Defoe free to his left but instead of playing him in, he tried to go it alone and ran into traffic. Selfish. "I''d be more impressed if Ian Copestake was obsessed with Lionel Blair rather than his long lost cousin Selma," says Ian Burch. Who says he isn''t?</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>GOAL! Newcastle 2-2 Tottenham (Ameobi, 86 min):</strong> Adebayor is made to pay for his selfishness moments ago in the most clinical style. Tottenham were under pressure and Parker tried to alleviate it by booting the ball away from danger. However he only got height on it rather than distance, the ball going to Tiote outside the area. He knocked it to his left for Cabaye, who instantly cushioned a fine pass through to Ameobi. Clear of his marker, he took the ball on to his left foot, and then from around 16 yards out he cracked an unstoppable low shot into the far corner, past the despairing dive by Friedel. What a brilliant finish.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>88 min:</strong> Incredible! Straight after Newcastle''s equaliser, Krul is called upon to stop Defoe winning it for Spurs. He broke into the area, and although his first shot was blocked by Coloccini, the ball fell kindly to him, but Krul parried away his follow-up effort.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>89 min:</strong> Adebayor is replaced by Roman Pavlyuchenko.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be five minutes of stoppage time.</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>90 min+2:</strong> What a double miss from Coloccini! Modric was booked for a foul on the left that gave Newcastle a free-kick. Ryan Taylor bent it in beautifully and Coloccini broke clear of his marker, only to somehow direct his volley from six yards out away from goal! It almost served as an assist for Ameobi, who couldn''t react quickly enough. The ball was eventually poked back to Coloccini, who turned and smashed the ball wide of the right post! What a pulsating ending.</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>90 min+3:</strong> Gutierrez''s strong run leads to a chance for him to shoot from the edge of the area, but his weak drive is blocked and Tottenham hack it clear with some difficulty.</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>90 min+5:</strong> On the left, Ameobi tricks his way past two challenges and then tries to cross. It''s blocked by Livermore, and the cries for handball are vociferous - and ignored by Lee Probert!</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>90 min+6:</strong> One last chance for Newcastle but Gutierrez''s low sighter is straight at Friedel.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peep!</strong> And there''s the final whistle. Phew, what a cracking end to that match. The ball did strike Livermore on the left arm, but it was ball to hand. Neither side really deserved to win, although Tottenham will feel they should have done, not least because they twice gave away the lead. Newcastle remain unbeaten. It''s not hard to work out why.

The event consists of 66 responses, in the form of plays, poems&nbsp;and song, to the books of the King James Bible. But, although I retired&nbsp;from the initial 24-hour showing&nbsp;after seeing a mere nine of the&nbsp;plays, I feel free to offer a few general observations.</p><p>One is that, in a world where the Bible&nbsp;is less part of the common culture than The X Factor, some of the responses carry little weight: what, for&nbsp;instance, is one to make of Daisy Hasan''s translation of Joshua into a hip Judaic proselytiser in modern India, unless one has recently read the original? Multiple authorship also leads&nbsp;to enormous divergencies in tone&nbsp;and quality: it is disconcerting to move from the flip jokiness of Jeanette Winterson''s response to Genesis, in which Catherine Tate reads out God''s tweets on earth''s formation, to the awestruck, if diffuse, poem that is Anne Michaels''s answer to Exodus.</p><p>The pieces that work are those that seize on a single story or incorporate some of the original biblical language. Neil Bartlett movingly uses the fable of Balaam and his Ass both to recall his boyhood memories and to underline the revelation that comes from seeing life from the perspectives of others. In Beardy, Tom Wells wittily turns the Samson of Judges into a circus strong-man besotted by the bearded lady and ready to bring the big tent tumbling down. Best of all is Stella Duffy''s response to the Book of Ruth, in which the heroine and her mother-in-law, Naomi, are portrayed as two resilient women surviving loss and loneliness together in an alien land: as played by Kate Duchêne and Nikki Amuka-Bird, under Philip Wilson''s direction, this becomes a powerful testament to sisterhood.</p><p>Obviously, there is a lot I never got to&nbsp;see: Neil LaBute''s answer to Job, Tim Rice''s lyric responding to Chronicles 2 and Rowan Williams''s reaction to Lazarus. But although this is a big, bold enterprise that it is perfectly possible to see in smaller, evening-long chunks, I question the whole notion of a 24-hour marathon. You wouldn''t attempt to read the Bible in a day, so the attempt to encompass everything from Genesis to Revelation in a single theatrical arc strikes me as perverse: it allows little time for reflection and, even after two-and-a-half hours, left me feeling subject to sustained oral bombardment. I will, however, say one thing for the venture: it makes you want to go to the book.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/stage&k=Theatre&k=The+Bible&k=Stage&k=Culture" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/stage/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/stage/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Sixty-Six+Books+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1648358&ch=Stage&c2=60753&c4=Theatre%2CThe+Bible%2CStage%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Michael+Billington&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648358&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: stage/2011/oct/16/sixty-six-books-review|2011-10-16T21:13:29+01:00|1f9e7574d94e7130b646cb6f0d0a7e8478ae9b7e -->', NULL, 'Stage', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:32'),

Mick McCarthy''s side slumped to a fifth straight league defeat here – their worst run in the top flight since 1984, when they were relegated – as goals from Chris Brunt and Peter Odemwingie secured their Black Country rivals a much-needed victory of their own that lifted them out of the relegation zone.</p><p>Wolves had no shortage of possession, especially in the opening 45 minutes, but the absence of a cutting edge was every bit as glaring as the defensive vulnerability that West Bromwich Albion ruthlessly exposed with some classic counter-attacking in their first home win of the season.</p><p>The Albion supporters were jumping the gun when they chanted "You''re getting sacked in the morning," as McCarthy looked on forlornly from the touchline, but tThere is no disputing that these are worrying times for the Wolves manager. After collecting two wins and a draw from their opening three matches, they have failed to pick up a point since. "It''s my team. It''s my responsibility," McCarthy said. "But it''s no more pressure than I''ve been under normally."</p><p>McCarthy was unhappy with Paul Scharner, the Albion midfielder, whom he accused of "taking the piss", after the Austrian angered Stephen Hunt and Stephen Ward by lifting his shirt late on in the game to reveal a top that McCarthy seemed to think carried a message.</p><p>"I don''t know what it said on it but it was obviously something that annoyed Wardy at the time," said McCarthy. "I''m all right with them having a backheel but it''s kind of taking the piss and rubbing people''s noses in it [to do that with the shirt] when you''re getting beaten."</p><p>Scharner disputed that he was guilty of anything inflammatory. "My kids gave it to me, it''s just a T-shirt with a big Albion logo on it and that''s what I showed to the supporters," he said.</p><p>Wolves have bigger issues to worry about. They face Swansea City at home on Saturday and will have to show a marked improvement at both ends of the pitch if they are to get out of their current rut. Roger Johnson was particularly poor here and will be keen to see the back of the outstanding Shane Long, whose movement and pace troubled the Wolves captain throughout.</p><p>Wolves fell behind in the eighth minute. Billy Jones, who impressed on his Premier League debut, ran on to Youssouf Mulumbu''s pass before expertly cutting the ball back for Brunt to sweep home. Kevin Doyle came close to equalising six minutes later, when Jonas Olsson blocked superbly, and Johnson squandered a decent headed chance midway through the second half.</p><p>West Bromwich, however, always looked menacing when they broke upfield and it was no surprise when they added a second goal, Scharner''s neat backheel inviting Odemwingie, who has endured a difficult start to the season and had only come off the substitutes'' bench four minutes earlier, to drill into the bottom corner. "The goal will be good for him," Roy Hodgson, the Albion manager, said. "It''s important for him that he realises that we''re all 100 per cent behind him and that we don''t expect him to shoulder the whole burden to keep us in the league."</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/football&k=Premier+League+2011-12&k=West+Brom&k=Wolverhampton+Wanderers&k=Football&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=West+Bromwich+Albion+2-0+Wolverhampton+Wanderers+%7C+Premier+League+match+report+Article+1648397&ch=Football&c2=60753&c4=Premier+League+2011-12%2CWest+Brom+%28Football%29%2CWolverhampton+Wanderers+%28Football%29%2CFootball%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Stuart+James+at+The+Hawthorns&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648397&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: football/2011/oct/16/west-bromwich-albion-wolverhampton-wanderers1|2011-10-16T21:13:29+01:00|4a5000a5876959c336053fac00e8e65afd629b1a -->', NULL, 'Football', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:32');

Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur ought not to be separated even in their satisfaction, even though a team held to a draw on their own ground would usually be crestfallen. Alan Pardew''s side, however, maintained their unbeaten record despite being required to equalise twice. At present Newcastle are bringing encouragement to a St James'' Park crowd whose spirit can be officially certified unbreakable after so many years of crashing anticlimax.</p><p>Given time, Tottenham will be able to look beyond the late leveller from the substitute Shola Ameobi. There was still merit in a display that had enterprise and even an air of durability for much of the game. It was regrettable that Ledley King should have to go off injured in the first half but even if there was no clean sheet on this occasion Spurs have long since understood that it would be absurd to waste their lives agonising over his condition.</p><p>There is cause for solidly based hope at Tottenham. The club is inclined to brood on matters such as the limitation of its White Hart Lane home as a revenue generator but Harry Redknapp does still have a squad with depth in some areas. Indeed, this fixture, as an open and exhausting contest, was ideal for the introduction of Jermain Defoe, who then gave the visitors a 2-1 advantage. It will be a gruelling assignment for Redknapp''s side to finish in the top four but they are better equipped than he often implies.</p><p>If there is any unease in the mind of the Spurs manager it will concern the fact that half a dozen league goals have been conceded in four away games. There was a sense here that Newcastle could not be stopped in their tracks with the considerable presence of Cheik Tioté in the centre of midfield. There was a certain lack of vigilance and, in consequence, Tottenham could never completely drain the hope from St James'' Park spectators who had no cause to suppose their side were doomed.</p><p>It somehow felt natural that Ameobi should level the scores with a spectacular drive in the 86th minute, after a flick from Yohan Cabaye. This game might as well have been designed as an examination of Newcastle''s perseverance. They fell behind after 40 minutes because of lapses in concentration. Pardew''s side could have survived the incident after Cabaye lost possession, but Steven Taylor made an unnecessary challenge on Emmanuel Adebayor, who was running towards the wing rather than the posts. Rafael van der Vaart showed a far greater sense of direction than the centre-back when tucking the spot-kick beyond Tim Krul.</p><p>Adversity, however, prodded Newcastle into effectiveness. Demba Ba levelled after 48 minutes. At that stage the loss of King had been barely noticed by Tottenham. That event was swamped by the general inconsequentiality of the action. The goal, however, saw Jonás Gutiérrez tear past Luka Modric and Kyle Walker, with Brad Friedel getting to Ba''s volley but grasping it when the ball was behind the line.</p><p>The early insipidness of the match seemed merely to have been saving its hoard of incident for the latter stages. Adebayor was close to restoring Tottenham''s lead with an effort, following service from Modric, that went marginally beyond the far post. Van der Vaart was soon to crash a drive straight at Krul.</p><p>Van der Vaart would be replaced by a more natural predator in Defoe, who put Tottenham in front once more, finishing a ball from Modric. No one could quibble if either manager saw this as a contest where fallibility was on the rise. The unstable action might have indicated that neither side should expect too much of this campaign but the fixture itself was absorbing precisely because of the accidents and pervasive fallibility.</p><p>There was scope, above all, for the predatory Defoe. Tottenham may lack the means of some clubs in the upper reaches of the table but an away draw of this sort suggests a purpose and organisation that will keep them to the fore, even if they will rue the fact that they could not hold tight to the lead for those closing minutes. Newcastle, for their part, are far from despair.</p><p>Most people can recall a grandiosity of intent that once saw the club spend heavily without quite getting the return on investment anticipated. The drama too often left an ache in the hearts of supporters. This is a less histrionic period and perhaps those fans will be left with a modest satisfaction.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/football&k=Premier+League+2011-12&k=Newcastle+United&k=Tottenham+Hotspur&k=Football&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Newcastle+United+2-2+Tottenham+Hotspur+%7C+Premier+League+match+report+Article+1648413&ch=Football&c2=60753&c4=Premier+League+2011-12%2CNewcastle+United+%28Football%29%2CTottenham+Hotspur+%28Football%29%2CFootball%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Kevin+McCarra+at+St+James%27+Park&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648413&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: football/2011/oct/16/newcastle-united-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league|2011-10-16T21:13:29+01:00|94290c62f8d850711239ded67905d843a86cd75d -->', NULL, 'Football', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:32'),

Unlikely bedfellows, but Martin Suckling fuses these influences and more into his engrossing, haunting and self-assured storm, rose, tiger. The Glasgow-born composer has been earmarked as an emerging talent; this latest work, written for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, confirms the distinctness of&nbsp;his voice. It couples fierce intellect with the musical sensibility of a fine violinist, and offers a generous hand to&nbsp;listeners by keeping earthy hooks at&nbsp;the core of its clever tricks. The final&nbsp;resounding passacaglia strays toward filmic, but weird micro-tuning&nbsp;and fuzzy layering keep us on our&nbsp;toes.</p><p>Only a week into the new season, and&nbsp;the SCO is already sounding well&nbsp;warmed up. Principal conductor Robin Ticciati continues to push for transparent, spacious and classically articulated playing, even (and particularly effectively) in postclassical repertoire. He tests the balance between&nbsp;broad scale and careful nuance,&nbsp;which here brought out the thrill and madness in Schumann''s Fourth Symphony – as it had in last week''s season opener, Berlioz''s Symphonie Fantastique. Occasionally, a&nbsp;gesture jars a bit as over-done or half-baked. But more often, the risk-taking reveals inner parts you never knew were there, and prompts alert playing more akin to a big chamber group than a small orchestra.</p><p>Maybe it''s hard for visiting soloists to&nbsp;feel part of this cosy Ticciati-SCO bond, but Viktoria Mullova seemed to make little effort. Reading Beethoven''s Violin Concerto from the score while Ticciati conducted from memory, she grafted her lines on to the orchestra rather than joining them. Her sound was&nbsp;frosty, her attacks hurried and hard-edged; only the tuttis had a conspiring warmth to them. Mullova has&nbsp;a reputation for iciness that she didn''t do much to thaw here.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Classical+music&k=Robert+Schumann&k=Ludwig+van+Beethoven&k=Music&k=Culture" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=SCO%2FTicciati%2FSuckling+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1648361&ch=Music&c2=60753&c4=Classical+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CRobert+Schumann%2CLudwig+van+Beethoven%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Kate+Molleson&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648361&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2011/oct/16/sco-ticciati-suckling-review|2011-10-16T21:13:29+01:00|2d97df2800782787a2e0d17c8944464ffe6bbe4c -->', NULL, 'Music', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:32'),

This week''s annual meeting may be on the Fox studio lot in Los Angeles, but there will only be a limited amount of drama. He sits on 40% of the votes, and while there are small shareholders in revolt, they are hardly likely to force change. Nor does it help that some of their demands are just plain daft: asking for 13 out of 15 directors to quit would leave nobody experienced in charge of the company. And above all, if you are judging on financial performance, what''s not to like? Operating profit (after stripping out some massive legal costs) was up 12%, and the voting shares are bouncing back from their post hacking lows from $14 in August to $17.27 at the time of writing.</p><p>The conclusion the Fox-to-Times conglomerate wants to draw is what it has always done: ignore the critics. There was serious talk inside the company a year ago about Murdoch splitting the chairman and chief executive roles, but this has gone away. A new non-executive director might join the board to fill the spot Elisabeth Murdoch was meant to take up, but this is hardly radical stuff. Yet, there ought to be a little more change than that, because the corporate problems are not over either.</p><p>The easy assumption had always been that James Murdoch would end up running the company, although in truth it is hard to think of an equivalent public company of similar size that would simply pass down the family line. If he does take over, how long is he supposed to be in charge? Another 40 years? And is it proven that James is as brilliant as his father? There is no shortage of obstacles ahead.</p><p>James Murdoch has to go before the culture select committee in the first half of November. It is likely that he can cook up a good explanation as to what happened at the over-analysed meeting with Colin Myler and Tom Crone over the "for Neville" email; in effect he can say that he did not appreciate, or was not led to appreciate its significance with the benefit of hindsight. But there is no good excuse for the disastrous decision of July 2009, in which he allowed News International to respond to the initial allegations of hacking by simply accusing the Guardian of choosing to "mislead the British public". When faced with serious allegations, the only sensible response is to investigate.</p><p>There is no explanation too for the string of political misjudgments on James''s watch: the ill-timed switch from Labour to Conservative; the astonishingly pugilistic speech in Edinburgh that offered no concessions to the middle ground; the company''s decision to become intimate with politicians (whose shelf life is far shorter than media moguls) – and even the decision to turn up and complain in person at the Independent''s offices because the paper ran an advertising campaign that he did not like. Nor is it just the politics. BSkyB, under James''s rule (he is still chairman), was similarly combative: seizing shares in ITV and fighting tooth and nail to keep them; battling endlessly with the regulator over Ofcom''s plans to cut Sky Sports prices (why are higher prices good for consumers?); squeezing rivals hard to control all types of film rights.</p><p>All fair in media and war no doubt, but at some point, you need friends as well as power. For News Corp, the obvious decision is to promote number two Chase Carey soon; indeed the Murdochs may be better off as shareholders on the sidelines rather than managers taking endless hits. Don''t bet on that happening, though.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/media&k=Media&k=Rupert+Murdoch&k=James+Murdoch&k=News+Corporation&k=Media+business" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Why+Rupert+Murdoch+needs+to+move+his+family+to+the+News+Corp+sidelines+Article+1648132&ch=Media&c2=60753&c4=Media%2CRupert+Murdoch+%28Media%29%2CJames+Murdoch+%28Media%29%2CNews+Corporation+%28Media%29%2CMedia+business&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Dan+Sabbagh&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648132&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: media/organgrinder/2011/oct/16/rupert-murdoch-news-corp-dan-sabbagh|2011-10-16T21:13:29+01:00|660b7834a733da193c36173add674bd60490104f -->', NULL, 'Media', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:32'),

Planning reform gives an early opportunity for improvement. [The government]  shouldintroduce a radically revised national planning policy framework with strong safeguards for nature and the landscape."</p><p>Obtaining planning permission for any development – from housing to wind farms, waste treatment plants or out-of-town supermarkets – is usually difficult and costly, as local authorities have strong powers of veto.</p><p>Developers argue that this is hampering growth prospects, pointing to the fact that house-building rates are far lower than they need to be to offer affordable housing to those in need.</p><p>Reforms to the complex planning system were one of the key promises made by Osborne on becoming chancellor.</p><p>He announced that under streamlined rules there would be a presumption in favour of "sustainable development", meaning that local authorities should look for reasons to go ahead with new projects on sites that previously might have been protected.</p><p>This will, ministers have made clear, include considering building on land that is currently zoned as green belt, a move that has angered many green&nbsp;campaigners.</p><p>But other groups have supported greater freedom in planning. William Worsley, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: "For years, national planning policy has undervalued the countryside and failed to meet the needs of rural areas. It is well documented that the countryside has become part dormitory, part theme park and part retirement home.</p><p>Rural businesses and communities have the same needs for jobs, homes and services that urban areas have, but rural England has suffered from urban-centric policies for decades, leading to a countryside that is less sustainable and less self-sufficient."</p><p>One of the problems is that the terms under which local authorities should change their rules have been only very vaguely defined, and opponents of the plans say it is unclear what sorts of development would be termed "sustainable". Countryside campaigners fear that the new presumption will give councils the right to ride roughshod over environmental protections.</p><p>Joan Walley, a Labour MP and chair of parliament''s environmental audit committee, which is also examining the proposals, called on the government to bring forward more detail: "If the new planning framework protects our green belt and countryside, as the government claims, then there should be no problem in defining sustainable development more clearly to avoid misinterpretation."</p><p>Another odd aspect of the plans is that, according to the UK''s wind industry association, Renewable UK, the plans could hamper some forms of development while encouraging others. Onshore wind farms would face increased hurdles under the proposals, while developments such as out-of-town shopping centres would be made easier.</p><p>In this debate, the role of the National Trust will be central. As one of the UK''s biggest member organisations, it commands respect across the political spectrum, and its leading figures – Jenkins and Fiona Reynolds, director-general – have shown a willingness to stand up to ministers and other vested interests.</p><p>At the front of ministers'' minds will be the forest sell-off debacle earlier this year, which saw one of the first defeats of a major coalition government policy.</p><p>The proposal by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to parcel out public forests, some to be sold to the highest bidder and others to be looked after by charities, was met with widespread opposition, from country grandees to the Socialist Workers party.</p><p>Ministers will also be well aware that the same charities that are now voicing concerns over the planning regulation proposals were instrumental in forcing the rethink on the forestry proposals, which resulted in the environment minister, Caroline Spelman, making a humiliating climbdown.</p><p>Although the National Trust did not adopt an official position on the forestry sell-off, it canvassed its members and provided a forum for them to make their views known. Crucially, the fact that the National Trust – one of the biggest owners and managers of woodland for public access in the UK today – was not consulted in any way before the government announced its proposals contributed to the U-turn, because it was perceived that in failing to gather this kind of support, the government had acted hastily and without sound advice.</p><p>The government is anxious not to be seen to make the same mistake this time, but it may be too late. The National Trust remains unconvinced by the reassurances given so far that the new planning laws will not mean a free-for-all. If ministers press ahead with their plans without concessions, they risk once again the wrath of middle England.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/politics&k=Planning+policy&k=Politics&k=Local+politics&k=Local+government&k=Communities&k=Society" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=MPs+sit+in+judgement+in+conservation+versus+construction+planning+battle+Article+1648420&ch=Politics&c2=60753&c4=Planning+policy%2CPolitics%2CLocal+politics+%28Politics%29%2CLocal+government+%28Society%29%2CCommunities+%28Society%29%2CSociety%2CEric+Pickles%2CGeorge+Osborne%2CUK+news%2CGreen+politics%2CGreen+building+%28Environment%29%2CEnvironment%2CEcotowns+%28environment%29%2CHousing+%28Society%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Fiona+Harvey%2C+environment+correspondent&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648420&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/2011/oct/16/conservation-versus-construction-planning-battle|2011-10-16T21:13:30+01:00|c0f405a7e2af8c20cc101b3e32ae7db6ba69bae1 -->', NULL, 'Politics', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:34'),

By <strong>Dan Sabbagh</strong>', '<p>Paula Kerger wants to correct a misconception about American television. The president and chief executive officer of PBS – the US Public Broadcasting Service – wants "as an American citizen" to share "another perspective on the United States separate from Hollywood". Which is why, 42 years after PBS was founded, the broadcaster is finally coming to the UK, with a new channel that she hopes will "give people here in the UK a sense of how news is reported in the United States" and "through the investigative journalism, a real sense of some of the issues in the States".</p><p>PBS, a non-profit, in the US jargon, is barely known to the British viewer, although those who follow debates about media policy will have heard it compared negatively to the BBC. Unlike in Britain, public broadcasting was an afterthought in the US, with the three commercial networks leading the way, broadcasting coast-to-coast from the 1950s. PBS began in 1969, and 85% of its funding comes from philanthropic foundations and donations (recurring demands are a feature of the ad breaks), with the balance from the US Congress. Programming, which is Kerger''s part of the organisation, has $350m a year to play with, which hardly compares with the BBC''s licence fee income of £3.5bn. But somehow the organisation keeps the wheels turning.</p><p>"From time to time we have threats to our federal funding but each time we have worked through it because we have such a broad base of support," she says, helped by its popular children''s programming which is watched, PBS claims, by 77% of all US children.</p><p>Otherwise, PBS barely exists in the consciousness of Britons. Unless you have lived in the US (where it claims audiences larger than CNN and HBO) and watched its output, nobody would be able to name any of its programmes, with just one possible exception, Sesame Street. Not many of us would have caught PBS documentary Roads to Memphis, the story of Martin Luther King''s assassin James Earl Ray, which aired eight days ago on the obscure Yesterday channel. Which is why a whole channel, the first PBS has launched outside the US, is necessary. Kerger, who has been in charge since March 2006 following 13 years at the public broadcaster in New York, says she wanted to do something like this from the moment she stepped up to the job.</p><p>However, in true cash-constrained fashion, it only became possible because "we have an investor step forward to help us put the resources to help us do it". He is David Lyons, a Canadian oil and gas man, who runs the exploration company Orca (where Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, also sits on the board). Lyons has been badgering PBS to launch overseas for some time, after missing it during a spell living here. Kerger describes Lyons as "a venture philanthropist" and notes that "he grew up in Canada, grew up watching PBS there, and he has felt there is a range of material that would be of interest to this community", which is how she describes the UK.</p><p>The scale of Lyons''s investment is not revealed, but this is intended to be a commercial venture. PBS has gone down the road of signing up a pay deal with Sky, and would like another with Virgin Media, which means there will be no prospect of the channel appearing on Freeview. "We hopefully will make some money because it is a commercial venture, but our primary interest in doing this is to exhibit our content to an international audience," Kerger says, because the previous strategy of trying to sell PBS shows to UK channels has clearly failed. That''s ironic, too, given that PBS local schedules are chock-full of often dated BBC and other British TV repeats, from New Tricks to Doc Martin.</p><p>Viewers can tune in to PBS UK from 1 November (Sky channel 166), and the schedule will focus on "non-fiction programming". A science show, Nova, will air on weeknights at 7.50pm; current affairs will be served with Frontline on weeknights at 9pm, followed by history programming – a series called American Experience comes just after 10pm. Kerger also repeatedly speaks up for the documentary maker Ken Burns. His five-part series, Prohibition, which, she says, has "just premiered in the US to very significant audience because of all the interest in Boardwalk Empire",  documents the rise and fall of the US ban on alcohol between 1920 and 1933. In total, she promises viewers "500 unique hours of content this year" and "1000 hours next year", which sounds like a lot, until you spread that out over 365 days.</p><p>Kerger describes PBS as having to position itself carefully against other offerings both in the US and the UK, arguing that there is hope for a serious alternative because on US cable schedules are now dominated by this "explosion of reality of shows". Many of which – from The Secret Millionaire to Supernanny – come from the UK, of course, although, with characteristic tact, Kerger says: "I wasn''t going to make that point". She notes  there are other US broadcasters "that started out doing work similar to public television, but, because the marketplace is a critical factor for them, have been unable to sustain programming that was their original mission". Like who? "Arts and Entertainment started out as a channel that was focused on that exactly, and now in the States it is a lot of CSI reruns."</p><p>Or there is the History Channel which, she says, "has developed out a whole genre of programmes that are reality-based, like Ice Road Truckers, and Pawn Stars", and to a lesser extent Discovery, which she gently accuses of populism by describing its science programming as "broader based". Later, though, she adds she is not trying to be holier than thou: "These are not value statements, these are different types of work," which is one way of putting it.</p><p>Not for nothing, though, is PBS based across the Potomac river from the US capital. The need to keep federal funders happy seems to make Kerger very diplomatic. Is Newshour, which rather unhelpfully is going to be aired the next day in the UK after it has been "complied" with Ofcom rules, designed as an antidote to Fox News? Or even, if we are going to be balanced about this, is it an antidote to the Democrat-oriented MSNBC? "No, we consider ourselves to be a broadcaster that serves both points of view," she replies. Press harder, and she says "I''m not working for Fox or MSNBC, so I don''t want to comment on their way of handling the news", before adding that impartiality (not a requirement in the US) is "profoundly important; there has to be a space where you can get the facts". Except the next day timing may mean that Newshour will struggle to catch on.</p><p>At first there will be no budget to commission British filmakers, but Kerger adds that "there certainly could be an opportunity in the future". Nevertheless, she insists it will be a UK channel with "a British voice" despite the lack of local input, a mandate fulfilled by having British continuity announcers. Nor, surprisingly, will there be much of the children''s programming, which Kerger first justifies by saying that in "our survey of the kids'' market you seem to be well served for kids'' content". So there won''t be any episodes of worthy, hour-long Sesame Street, which has not been on air in the UK since 2001, after spells on ITV and Channel 4.</p><p>Except that is hardly an important deficit: Kerger''s PBS UK promises to be one of the most interesting channel launches for some time, as long as the programming can deliver on the public service promise.</p><p><strong>CV</strong></p><p><strong>Age </strong>53</p><p><strong>Education</strong> University of Maryland</p><p><strong>Career</strong> <strong>1979</strong> Program development officer, US committee for Unicef <strong>1984</strong> director of development, International House <strong>1989 </strong>director of principal gifts, Metropolitan Opera Association <strong>1993 </strong>vice president/director of development WNET-TV <strong>2000 </strong>vice president/station manager <strong>2004</strong> executive vice president and chief operating officer<strong> 2006 </strong>president and chief executive officer, Public Broadcasting Service</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/media&k=US+television+industry&k=TV+news&k=Television+industry&k=Media&k=The+news+on+TV&k=Television" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Interview%3A+PBS+boss+Paula+Kerger+on+launching+a+UK+channel+Article+1648034&ch=Media&c2=60753&c4=US+television+industry%2CTV+news+broadcasters%2CTelevision+industry+%28Media%29%2CMedia%2CTV+news+%28TV+genre%29%2CTelevision+%28Culture%29%2CTelevision+and+radio+TV%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Dan+Sabbagh&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648034&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: media/2011/oct/16/paula-kerger-pbs-uk-channel-interview|2011-10-16T21:13:30+01:00|88484e2a3ba46742fb596f9b9079a8c3d0ee4142 -->', NULL, 'Media', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:34'),

Reich himself partnered <a href="http://www.neilpercy.com/" title="">Neil&nbsp;Percy</a> in the opening rendition of Clapping Music – a little less sharp than&nbsp;the one he took part in at the Proms in August. After a whole evening of Reich''s music in the company of the eminent composer, it was a foregone conclusion that the audience would rise in his honour at the close, though the actual quality of the music-making might not have earned such an accolade without his presence.</p><p>Yet <a href="http://www.kristjanjarvi.com/" title="">Kristjan Järvi</a>, a conductor whose&nbsp;podium personality sometimes overwhelms his performances, was remarkably restrained on this occasion, concentrating on careful traffic-management as opposed to flamboyant gestures.

Arguably neither of them shows Reich at his best, though both are&nbsp;worth encountering. Järvi''s deliberate performances needed more&nbsp;sense of impetus in places, more careful balancing in others, but the music''s clean textures and slowly mutating harmonic processes generally came through.</p><p>The earlier Desert Music – a more confident and characteristic work, setting poems by <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/119" title="">William Carlos Williams</a>, here enunciated by the 10 amplified singers of <a href="http://www.synergyvocals.com/" title="">Synergy Vocals</a> – is more consistently memorable both in its musical ideas and its overall trajectory. Here it spun along with its shimmering surfaces and intricate undercarriage intact, though once again Järvi needed to supply more momentum to achieve an ongoing sense of logical continuity.

"I am disappointed but all my attention and focus will now go towards the players playing on Friday (the bronze medal game against Australia)  and supporting them the best way I can," said Warburton.</p><p>The Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, felt Warburton should have received a yellow card at most, a sentiment that was shared by some of the England squad.

It should be the players that decide this, not referees."</p><p>Ben Foden wrote: "Hard luck to the Welsh boys, dug deep and hung in there. Have to feel for them, short-changed by a massive game-changing decision. Should have been a yellow, but never a red, poor Sam he was the heart and soul of Wales."</p><p>Wales decided not to appeal because of the risk of the ban being increased. Warburton will effectively only miss Friday''s match against Australia, a repeat of the 1987 play-off which Wales won 22-21, because he was due to rest for a couple of weeks after returning home. He will be available for Cardiff Blues'' Heineken Cup match against Racing Métro in Paris on 11&nbsp;November. Wales cannot replace him but they will call up someone for the injured prop Adam Jones, who tore a calf muscle against France. They want a specialist openside flanker to compete with Australia''s David Pocock  but Martyn Williams, who is in New Zealand as a television pundit, is injured and Justin Tipuric is facing a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday, after being cited for a tip tackle during an Ospreys victory in Munster.</p><p>"Wales will be debating the decision for many months to come, for the next four years even," said the back rower Ryan Jones. "It has cost us a place in the World Cup final because we were good enough to beat France. As a squad you have to think ''shit happens'' and get on with it.</p><p>"It is the most painful defeat of my career. Everyone was drained at the end and I have never sat in a dressing room like it before. We came to New Zealand to do great things and we were close to where we wanted to be. It was taken away."</p><p>The wing Leigh Halfpenny, who had to be consoled after the final whistle having failed with a long-range penalty to win the match, said the players were behind Warburton. "A yellow card would have sufficed for Sam and it would have helped the game. He has been phenomenal for us, an absolute credit and I cannot speak highly enough of the guy."</p><p>Wales will leave New Zealand on Saturday morning, hours after their third place play-off match against the Wallabies. Gatland has told the squad he will not relax his strict policy on drinking. He is treating Friday''s match as seriously as the semi-final, given the importance of world rankings next year for the 2015 World Cup. If Wales, who were fourth in the rankings before Saturday, stay there they will avoid the big three southern-hemisphere nations in the pool stages.</p><p>Gatland is set to change his coaching team after returning home. Rob Howley, who is in charge of the attack, has been linked with the head coach''s position at Bath, while the defence coach Shaun Edwards said on Sunday that his contract with Wales would finish after the weekend.</p><p>Edwards''s role at Wasps, where he has been head coach for 10 years, is likely to change on his return to Britain, with David Young having taken over as the director of rugby in the summer. Edwards will be linked with England, who are conducting various reviews after a poor World Cup.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=Rugby+World+Cup+2011&k=Wales+rugby+union+team&k=France+rugby+union+team&k=Rugby+union&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%3A+IRB+chief+backs+Alain+Rolland+on+Wales+red+card+Article+1648422&ch=Sport&c2=60753&c4=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%2CWales+rugby+union+team%2CFrance+rugby+union+team%2CRugby+union%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Paul+Rees+in+Auckland&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648422&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2011/oct/16/rugby-world-cup-alain-rolland|2011-10-16T21:13:30+01:00|36a8d0ee6f2cdda4f2635743c6dee74d05f84b15 -->', NULL, 'Sport', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:34'),

The Sun said the allegations had come from unnamed South Yorkshire police officers.</p><p>Aspinall said the report was deeply traumatic for families struggling with shock and grief, and "set the injustice in train" as the police prepared their case – to blame the supporters for causing the disaster – at Lord Justice Taylor''s official inquiry and the inquest.</p><p>As a result of the report, the Sun was subject to a boycott on Merseyside which has substantially lasted until today, despite attempts over the years by the paper to apologise.</p><p>In Taylor''s report into the disaster in August 1989, he described the Sun''s stories as "grave and emotive calumnies" and wholly discredited them, saying: "Not a single witness was called before the inquiry to support any of those allegations."</p><p>The then South Yorkshire police chief constable, Peter Wright, dissociated himself from the allegations, but Aspinall said the families had always felt it set public opinion and officialdom into believing that version of events.</p><p>"That story, that our children were drunken yobs, came as we were grieving for their loss, and we had to defend their good names," she said. "It set people''s minds, which you can still see even now, that the disaster was caused by the fans, not by the police losing control. That set the injustice in train, the real truth never came out at the inquest, and nobody in authority has ever been held to account.</p><p>"If we are now to discover the real truth, let the Sun tell us who gave them those lies which caused so much damage.</p><p>"If the Sun wants to make amends, they should reveal who it was, not allow their sources to hide behind anonymous briefings 22 years later, and help the families to understand what happened."</p><p>MPs will debate the current public document disclosure process in the Commons after more than 100,000 people signed an e-petition calling for "full government disclosure and publication of all documents" following a freedom of information request by the BBC.</p><p>The Hillsborough families have campaigned particularly to be told about the briefings South Yorkshire police gave to the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, when she visited Hillsborough the day after the disaster.</p><p>Her then press secretary, Sir Bernard Ingham, said later that he "learned on the day" that the disaster was caused by a "tanked-up mob" of Liverpool supporters.</p><p>The home secretary, Theresa May, is expected to restate the government''s position, which is a "commitment to full transparency about the Hillsborough disaster through full public disclosure".</p><p>That will, the government has confirmed, include cabinet papers from the time, but it is not yet clear if those discussions will detail the briefings Thatcher received from South Yorkshire police.</p><p>An independent panel of experts chaired by James Jones, the bishop of Liverpool, has been set up to examine the huge archive, and write a report setting out how the new material adds to public understanding of the disaster. The intention is to produce "as near to the full story as possible," Jones has said.</p><p>May is likely to say all the papers, including those of Thatcher''s cabinet at the time, should be disclosed first to the panel, who will share them with the victims'' families before they are released for publication.</p><p>"The government is happy for all the papers, including cabinet papers, to be released as soon as the panel so decides, in consultation with the families," a government spokesman said.</p><p>Andy Burnham, Labour''s shadow health spokesman, who, with another Merseyside Labour MP, Maria Eagle, initiated the public disclosure process on the 20th anniversary of the disaster two years ago, is expected to support that view.</p><p>He said he was already looking beyond the disclosure of documents to an ultimate process of "truth and reconciliation".</p><p>"After Hillsborough, the lie was set early on that Liverpool supporters had forced open an exit gate and rushed through it, when in fact the police had ordered the gate to be opened," Burnham said.</p><p>"What the families of innocent victims were then put through belongs to an era from which we have moved on, when the authorities were able to abuse ordinary people in a sickening way.</p><p>"When the full disclosure has happened and the report is written, I believe there should be an appropriate national response and process of reconciliation.</p><p>"The prime minister, David Cameron, gave a very dignified response to the Saville report into Bloody Sunday, and offered an unqualified apology for what took place.

Twenty‑four years after becoming the first nation to lift the Webb Ellis Cup, and 16 years after losing a final in Johannesburg with half their squad suffering from food poisoning, New Zealand will have another chance to win the trophy for a second time. As in 1987''s inaugural tournament, they will enjoy home advantage.</p><p>At a press conference on Sunday morning Marc Lièvremont, France''s head coach, remarked that he always supported the All Blacks in every match except those against his own nation. A few hours later he was given fresh evidence to justify of his admiration, and perhaps had his worst fears confirmed, as the All Blacks crushed the life out of Australia with a 20-6 victory that left no margin for doubt.</p><p>It will now be up to France to prove on Sunday that, despite their defeats to New Zealand and Tonga in the pool stage, they are more worthy of a place in the final than Wales, whose presence would have provided a showdown between two small nations who share a rugby obsession. On recent evidence, a victory for this France team over the All Blacks would be the biggest upset in the game''s history. It is hard to imagine them even coming close to the degree of resistance put up by Australia on Sunday night.</p><p>From the moment Quade Cooper, the Wallabies'' New Zealand-born fly-half and a hate object for the Eden Park crowd, sent the kick-off out on the full, forcing his forwards to trundle back for a scrum to the home side, the champions of 1991 and 1999 were struggling to get on terms with a team who believe this to be the year they lay a hoodoo to rest.</p><p>The All Blacks won on Sunday night with the only try of the game, scored by the rampaging centre Ma''a Nonu, in the sixth minute, plus four penalties by the scrum‑half Piri Weepu – who missed three other penalties and a conversion – and one drop goal by their third-choice fly-half, the 22-year-old Aaron Cruden, who played the whole 80 minutes and performed brilliantly in his second start for the team. A penalty by James O''Connor and Cooper''s drop goal constituted the sum of the Wallabies'' reply.</p><p>"We were beaten fair and square by a better side tonight," James Horwill, the defeated captain, said. "Any time they wanted to get down there and score points, they pretty much did."</p><p>Australia''s head coach, the former All Black full-back Robbie Deans, endorsed their conquerors'' standing as the heavy favourites to avenge defeats by France in the 1999 semi-final and the quarter-final four years ago. "They''re very well versed, they''re hungry, they''ve got a lot of support around here, and they''ll take a lot of stopping," he said.</p><p>Graham Henry, the famously tight-lipped head of New Zealand''s coaching team, was almost lyrical in his assessment of his side''s display. "The job''s not done yet," he said. "It''s very important for us to understand that and keep our feet on the ground. We''ve got a history with France and it''ll be another big occasion on Sunday."</p><p>He praised the backs, among them the full-back Israel Dagg and the wing Cory Jane who were photographed drinking and smoking in a late-night bar 72 hours before the quarter-final against Argentina. They were impeccable. "Our backfield play was pretty special," Henry said. His captain, the openside flanker Richie McCaw, is playing this tournament on one foot. The other had a screw inserted to help heal a stress fracture in February, and is painful enough to prevent him from training between matches. But shrewd tactics stopped his opposite number David Pocock, a rival for the title of the world''s best No7, from making any sort of impression.</p><p>So New Zealand are going to the final guided not by Daniel Carter, the aristocrat of fly-halves, ruled out by a groin injury in the middle of the tournament, but by a 22-year-old skateboarder who lost a testicle to cancer four years ago. Cruden had made only one start in an All Black shirt before Carter''s initial replacement, Colin Slade, also joined the injured list last week.</p><p>The new boy was as much of a star on Sunday night as Dagg, Jane or Nonu. His terrific half-break led to the penalty with which Weepu stretched the lead to 8-0, and his nerveless 35-metre drop goal made it 11-3 a few minutes after James O''Connor had got the Wallabies off the mark. The only false notes were an early pass thrown straight into touch ahead of Jane, a kick charged down on the stroke of half-time and a missed penalty from 48m a few minutes from the end of the match, when Weepu was temporarily off the pitch.</p><p>Henry, who has an acid sense of humour and hates giving anything away on or off the pitch, was at his most typical when asked for a response to the pledge by Jo Maso, France''s team manager, not to do anything to prevent New Zealand wearing their famous black strip at the final. Maso said that France, who have been wearing blue shirts and shorts of an unusually dark shade, would voluntarily switch to their white second strip for the occasion – a decision that is traditionally made on the toss of a coin.</p><p>"It''s a good gesture," Henry said. "We''re the All Blacks, we''re playing at home and we wear black, so it''s an obvious one. But I do thank him."</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=Rugby+World+Cup+2011&k=Australia+rugby+union+team&k=New+Zealand+rugby+union+team&k=Rugby+union&k=Sport" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%3A+New+Zealand+close+on+second+Webb+Ellis+triumph+Article+1648412&ch=Sport&c2=60753&c4=Rugby+World+Cup+2011%2CAustralia+rugby+union+team%2CNew+Zealand+rugby+union+team%2CRugby+union%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Richard+Williams+at+Eden+Park&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648412&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2011/oct/16/rugby-world-cup-new-zealand-australia2|2011-10-16T21:13:30+01:00|913589d714ae5bdeed8ea116a1718fec3bc62e24 -->', NULL, 'Sport', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:34'),

International editions were always more costly to produce, and eventually the costs were disproportionate in an era when all papers are facing declining revenues.</p><p>They were also awkward to produce, as the Guardians published abroad were always smaller versions of the main paper, which was filleted and remade for the purpose by a team of journalists in London.

The Guardian''s distribution team is currently in negotiations with some large distributors in major European markets to act as third parties that will print the paper and sell in key areas.</p><p>When the Guardian''s international edition closed, it was selling 3,500 to 5,000 copies per issue out of a foreign circulation of 12,000 to 15,000.

"Whatever is in this Beecroft report, I think, will be swiftly swept away," the Lib Dem Home Office minister told the Observer.</p><p>"These are hideous suggestions … What I would say about them is that it would be absolutely extraordinary if we were to abandon our commitment to those flagship policies.</p><p>"It is absolutely vital that we deliver on our rhetoric around family-friendly issues. I wouldn''t support that, Nick [Clegg] wouldn''t support that, and quite frankly David Cameron was campaigning last year on being the most family-friendly government. I would be very surprised if he supported that."</p><p>Featherstone was also scathing about Steve Hilton, the prime minister''s policy guru, who has been critical of maternity pay. "Well, I might talk about scrapping Steve Hilton," she said.</p><p>The Financial Times reported in June that Hilton had suggested that maternity rights actually worked against women. "Steve thinks that they are the biggest obstacle to women finding work, because companies know they are required by law to offer maternity leave," one Whitehall source told the FT.</p><p>The newspaper suggested that consumer rights were hampering the economic recovery. "[Steve] also wanted to suspend all consumer rights legislation for nine months to see what would happen," the source told the FT. "Some of his ideas are great but a lot of time is spent at an official level trying to deconstruct his maddest thoughts."</p><p>The row over maternity rights highlights a dilemma facing Downing Street amid signs that Britain faces sluggish growth for the foreseeable future. On one side, the prime minister faces intense pressure from business to ease the burden of regulation. On the other side polling shows that women, particularly those lower down the income scale, are abandoning the coalition as the spending cuts begin to bite.</p><p>An internal Downing Street memo, leaked to the Guardian last month, showed that officials have drawn up a series of proposals to win back women and to show that the prime minister is still committed to leading the "most family-friendly government ever". These include introducing personal budgets for maternity services to allow women to shop around for services.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/politics&k=Lynne+Featherstone&k=David+Cameron&k=Liberal-Conservative+coalition&k=Women+in+politics&k=Maternity+%26+paternity+rights&k=Liberal+Democrats" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=David+Cameron+urged+to+abandon+%27hideous%27+plans+to+cut+maternity+rights+Article+1648425&ch=Politics&c2=60753&c4=Lynne+Featherstone%2CDavid+Cameron%2CCoalition+Liberal-Conservative+coalition%2CWomen+in+politics%2CMaternity+and+paternity+rights%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CSociety%2CFamily+finances+%28UK+consumer%29%2CLife+and+style%2CWelfare+%28Politics%29%2CUK+news%2CWomen+and+women%27s+interests&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Nicholas+Watt&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648425&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/2011/oct/16/maternity-rights-featherstone-david-cameron|2011-10-16T21:13:31+01:00|2d3ec627a41dd4c68c8f2875fe68362da46d276c -->', NULL, 'Politics', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:34'),

But on Monday, in Delhi, it will take a big reversal of fortune if they are not to go to Mohali for the third one-day international with their hopes for the five-match series hanging by a thread.</p><p>In the first match at Hyderabad, despite all the preparation over the previous 10 days, they were outplayed in all departments of the game to an alarming degree, beaten by a young side in their infancy as a unit. That Mahendra Singh Dhoni won an important toss, had first use of a pitch that was to deteriorate markedly as the game progressed, condemned England to fielding in the heat of the day, and himself played one of his finest innings cannot mask the fact that England played so poorly they might well have lost comfortably in any case.</p><p>It is not in the nature of Andy Flower in particular – a pragmatist without sentiment when it comes to the selection of his teams, to which Ian Bell might offer testament – to panic. While he has said he would not be afraid to make changes if he felt they were right, it would be unusual if at first he did not simply demand a massive improvement from those who underperformed in the first game. A chance for redemption in other words. But in the short and medium term there are several, including Craig Kieswetter, Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, and Samit Patel, who are under scrutiny and for whom this series might be make or break. In Flower''s eyes everyone deserves a fair crack, but with an increasing number of young players waiting to make the breakthrough, the opportunity will not be limitless.</p><p>In Hyderabad, India took the batting powerplay as late as was possible and used it as a launching pad for the final 15 overs. With the pitch starting to show erratic bounce and offering turn, that put the game beyond England''s reach by the halfway point. Until Dhoni and Suresh Raina came together, the bowlers had done a creditable job. There will have been an inquest, though, into how Alastair Cook handled his bowling resources once Dhoni came to the crease at the end of the 29th over. By then Graeme Swann had bowled seven of his 10 overs and Dhoni and Raina, knowing his capability, were content to see him off. Swann''s figures, well as he bowled, flattered as a result.</p><p></p><p>The timing of Swann''s overs smacked too much of a preconceived template. On Dhoni''s arrival, Cook did turn to Jade Dernbach, but he could have introduced Steven Finn, who bowled rapidly, to try to rough him up. And would Swann not have been a better option during the final 10 overs than either Patel or Ravi Bopara?</p><p>Then comes the question of length and pace. During the powerplay, when the assault started with 59 runs from five overs, England, using Tim Bresnan, Dernbach and Finn, concentrated on bowling full, getting the yorker in as often as possible. Dhoni is an expert hitter of yorkers, however. That consideration, when added to the fact that the straight boundaries at Hyderabad are much shorter than those at the sides, might have made the short ball and the slow bouncer an easier option with which to defend. Back of a length might also have exploited the low bounce although this was much more apparent in the second innings.</p><p>In fact, during the powerplay, England did not use the slower ball as much as they have done in other matches. Dernbach, who has the best repertoire, used just four in two overs (one of which produced five wides) and Bresnan three: that is seven in what proved to be 34 balls of which Dhoni received four and Raina three. Too many or too few? Only experience will provide the answer. At one time the rule of thumb was to use a variation only when other methods failed. Now bowlers try to read a batsman''s mind. Maybe at times, things just get too complicated.</p><p><strong>Teams for second ODI at Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, 10am BST</strong></p><p><strong>England</strong> (from) AN Cook (capt), C Kieswetter (wkt), IJL&nbsp;Trott, KP&nbsp;Pietersen, RS Bopara, JM Bairstow, SR Patel, TT Bresnan, GP&nbsp;Swann, JW Dernbach, ST Finn, IR Bell, SG Borthwick, CR&nbsp;Woakes.</p><p><strong>India</strong> (from) MS Dhoni (capt, wkt), P Patel, A Rahane, G&nbsp;Gambhir, V Kohli, S Raina, R Jadeja, P Kumar, R Ashwin, R Vinay Kumar, U&nbsp;Yadav, R Sharma, V Aaron, M Tiwary, S Aravind.</p><p><strong>Umpires</strong> B Bowden (NZ) and S Tarapore (Ind).</p><p><strong>Third umpire</strong> S Asnani (Ind). <strong>Match referee</strong> R Mahanama (SL).</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=England+in+India+2011&k=England+cricket+team&k=Sport&k=Cricket" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=England+must+learn+fast+if+they+are+to+keep+pace+with+India+in+Delhi+Article+1648433&ch=Sport&c2=60753&c4=England+in+India+2011%2CEngland+cricket+team%2CSport%2CCricket&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Mike+Selvey+in+Delhi&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648433&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2011/oct/16/england-india-delhi|2011-10-16T21:13:33+01:00|fa3351cb484a82c94c6c2965c56f52e12335bdaf -->', NULL, 'Sport', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:36'),

French and German banks, which lent billions of euros to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, will also be sheltered by the deal.</p><p>Geithner is convinced the French and Germans now recognise the problem, but reading his body language and the way he spoke about the prospects for meeting the six-day deadline, he was more circumspect. He said there was an enormous amount of detail to work through before plans would look convincing and hinted that time was running desperately short.</p><p>Geithner is also concerned that Merkel in particular is more concerned about rushing through reforms of the system before tackling the problems at the heart of the crisis. Some 38 pieces of EU legislation have either been put on the statute or are in the pipeline.</p><p>There have always been several problems with this rush to legislate, at least on this scale. First it distracts from the immediate problem of tackling the EU''s debts. It whacks banks and other financial institutions when they are already on their knees, and the legislation heaps costs on the finance industry that, in turn, hamper growth. Without banks to lend, especially to smaller companies, we have no investment.</p><p>It is this last point that most exercised Geithner. He openly warned the EU against rushing to ball-and-chain the banks and make a crisis certain.</p><p>There is a flaw to the Geithner plan of massive guarantees and insurances for Wall Street that keeps them afloat and lending, and it can be seen in a park only a stone''s throw from the New York stock exchange. The Occupy Wall Street campaigners are disgusted that propping up the banks means allowing the old rapacious bonus culture to go unreformed.</p><p>Geithner argues there are many on Wall Street who are suffering because they are paid in shares and not cash. Some US bank shares are down by a half or more since the summer. But that ignores the wider picture.</p><p>If the euro is saved, with billions more in taxpayer loans and guarantees, those bank shares will rocket and the bankers will be back in clover, more than they are already.</p><p>The US treasury secretary worries that Europe needs international investors on board, only to reckon it can win a game of chicken. When countries have borrowed so much from US pension funds, Middle Eastern petrodollar sovereign funds and the Chinese, they need private investors.</p><p>In 2008 the US treasury dared the markets to bet against the government and lost. It wants the EU to heed that experience.</p><p>Left to their own devices, traders panic, fearful on behalf of their investor clients that further losses lie just round the corner. The panic, far from being the invisible hand of the markets lauded by many right-wing economists, is a bludgeoning stick causing pain and unemployment wherever it strikes.</p><p>In these circumstances, reforms to tackle banks, brokers and investors should be delayed while protester-friendly taxes on wealth go ahead.</p><p>There is another crisis looming, possibly in only a few years. But it will come from another direction –the savings in China, Germany, Japan and the US looking to spark another asset boom. Tackling that situation poses even bigger problems for politicians.</p><p>But first we need some sustainable growth, and to avert a euro debt crisis.</p><p><em>phillip.inman@guardian.co.uk</em></p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/business&k=Economics&k=Business&k=European+debt+crisis&k=European+banks" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/business/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/business/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Europe+finally+listening+to+Geithner+Article+1648435&ch=Business&c2=60753&c4=Economics+%28Business%29%2CBusiness%2CEuropean+debt+crisis%2CEuropean+banks+%28business%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Phillip+Inman%2C+economics+correspondent&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648435&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: business/2011/oct/16/europe-finally-listening-to-geithner|2011-10-16T21:13:33+01:00|dfcc169fd21f8220f38d82c392d8df174fa698d6 -->', NULL, 'Business', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:36'),

Israeli peace activists say the intention is to solidify Israel''s claim to all of Jerusalem and to minimise the amount of the city ceded to an independent Palestine. Work could begin as early as next year.</p><p>A fortnight ago, Israel drew strong international condemnation over plans to expand an existing settlement, Gilo, by about 1,200 homes. Meir Margalit, a leftwing member of the Jerusalem council who holds the portfolio overseeing the east of the city, said that the Givat Hamatos plan had more serious implications because, not only is it much larger but, for the first time in quarter of a century, it established a new colony.</p><p>"This is a big deal because this is a new settlement. It''s not more houses in an existing settlement but a new one that takes one of the last reserves of land remaining for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem," he said. "I don''t want to be overly dramatic but this will be that last nail in the coffin of the peace process.</p><p>"The government knows the Palestinians cannot live with this, that settlements are the most important issue for them. The people behind this are pyromaniacs and terrorists because they are lighting fires all over the place that at the end of the day will set up a new wave of terrorist attacks."</p><p>The plans were submitted for approval by Israel''s interior minister, Eli Yishai, a member of the religious, rightwing Shas party. They are likely to be backed by the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who is competing with Shas for the support of Jewish settlers and rightwing voters. Netanyahu has repeatedly said that Israel regards itself as free to build anywhere it chooses within the area it defines as Jerusalem, which cuts deeper into the West Bank since the municipal boundaries were extended after the occupation of the east of the city began in 1967.</p><p>Givat Hamatos would be the first major new Jewish settlement since Netanyahu approved the construction of nearby Har Homar in 1997, during his first term as prime minister.</p><p>The government has sought to minimise the significance of the plans by saying they have been around for several years and that no final decision has been taken. The proposal was originally drafted three years ago and then put on hold. But last week, with attention focused on the pending release of Gilat Shalit after five years captivity in Gaza, they were quietly revived and submitted for a 60-day public comment period, a last step before a final vote on approval. The decision will be made by the Jerusalem municipal council where there is broad support for settlements.</p><p>The move was welcomed by David Hershovitz, a rightwing member of the city council''s planning committee. He told the Jerusalem Post: "Givat Hamatos is a prerequisite for massive building in Jerusalem."</p><p>Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the Givat Hamatos proposal "makes a mockery of … international efforts to bring about a just and lasting peace."</p><p>On Sunday, the British foreign secretary, William Hague, condemned "this provocative step, which further encloses East Jerusalem". Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, described the Givat Hamatos plans as "deplorable". She said the plans undermine peace efforts by breaching Israel''s responsibility to create "an environment of trust conducive to negotiations".</p><p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the Givat Hamatos plans are "contrary to international law".</p><p>"Recent developments in this regard have been unacceptable, particularly as efforts are ongoing to resume negotiations," he said.</p><p>Margalit said that he believes the government is deliberately seeking to undermine attempts to revive talks.</p><p>"From the one side, Netanyahu says he is ready to negotiate; from the other, the government does this and undermines any possibility of negotiations with the Palestinians," he said.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Israel&k=Middle+East&k=World+news&k=Palestinian+territories&k=Judaism" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Israel+plans+new+settlement+of+2%2C600+that+will+isolate+Arab+East+Jerusalem+Article+1648414&ch=World+news&c2=60753&c4=Israel+%28News%29%2CMiddle+East+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CPalestinian+territories+%28News%29%2CJudaism+%28News%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Chris+McGreal+in+Jerusalem&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648414&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2011/oct/16/israel-settlement-isolate-arab-jerusalem|2011-10-16T21:13:33+01:00|eb04cc8fae3fb615e64a68674a2512ef7d2a956d -->', NULL, 'World news', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:36'),

In the wonderful world of personal video recorders (PVR) some 32% of drama series and 26% of soaps are watched this way, then often thrown back into the Barb-rated accounting as Viewing on the Same Day As Live (Vosdal) statistics.</p><p>What sort of people time-shift most zealously? Young adults between 25 and 34 – and educated, professional ABC1s. Loads of Guardian readers, in short.</p><p>Enough acronyms, though. The point isn''t the jargon of the measuring trade that turns data from 5,100 households a week into a portrait of gogglebox Britain. The point is what, inexorably, time-shifting is doing to our lives. For the ads are the least part of the problem. It''s the programmes in between that need shifting too.</p><p>Take <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing" title="">Strictly Come Dancing</a>, on Saturday nights.

And life itself comes back to echo that snatched, unsteady state. My new Radio Times website doesn''t just tell me what is on screen today. It offers an individual selection of what I''ll like based on choices past. My media existence is pre-vetted, pre-screened, almost prescribed, courtesy of Sky+ or TiVo.

Although the internet gives the public unprecedented access to music, getting playlisted on the radio is still the key way to gain exposure to a wider audience, and sell records, in the UK.</p><p>In the US, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/apr/16/payola-internet-radio" title="">payola – the illegal practice of paying or in any other way bribing a radio station to play your song</a> – has existed since the advent of pop music. The widespread use of payola in the 70s and 80s was described in detail in the book Hit Men, and as recently as 2005-06 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4788762.stm" title="">three of the major labels were indicted and settled out of court for pay-for-play practices</a>.</p><p>Although no such lawsuits have been launched in the UK, there have been plenty of accusations of conflict of interest when it comes to those who decide what gets played on the radio. When the dance DJ Pete Tong joined BBC Radio 1, more than 15 years ago, his day job was working as A&amp;R manager for London Records, and he was accused of favouring records signed to the label.</p><p>In 1996, Richard Park, then the programme controller of Capital Radio, formed Wildstar Records, uniting Capital Radio Group and Telstar Records in a 50-50 joint venture. Wildstar signed Craig David, who became one of the label''s biggest artists in the late 90s. Did that connection make the station more likely to playlist artists signed to the label, such as David?</p><p>Capital Radio is now owned by Global Radio, which also owns Heart, Xfm and Gold, making it a group with 20 million listeners. Global also owns an artist management company, which represents bands such as the Wanted and Cover Drive. Last year, Ofcom amended the rules for commercial TV, allowing product placement in order to implement an EU directive. It is said that some commercial radio stations lobbied for radio to be included in this section, arguing that songs played in their shows were, in effect, product placement for the artists. The music industry was horrified, suggesting that this sounded very much like payola.</p><p>Eventually Ofcom sent a clear message to the radio industry by adding clause 10.5 to its Broadcasting Code, stating: "No commercial arrangement that involves payment, or the provision of some other valuable consideration, to the broadcaster may influence the selection or rotation of music for broadcast." Breaking Ofcom rules can have serious repercussions – it can result in fines of hundreds of thousands of pounds or even having your licence revoked. Yet it''s difficult to prove the absence of payola – that an artist would have been playlisted anyway, without a financial incentive.</p><p>In 2006-07, questions surfaced regarding Jo Whiley''s choice of acts on her Radio 1 morning show. Whiley featured two high-profile live sets by the Hoosiers and the Automatic, which were both managed by her husband, Steve Morton. The sessions were included on two Live Lounge compilation CDs, which sold a combined total of 1.26m copies. The BBC said that Whiley had noted her husband''s interests on an internal register  and that she had no influence on the Radio 1 playlist and played no part in selecting songs for the Live Lounge albums.</p><p>I''m sure the reason why Global signed the Wanted to its management arm was because the band were expected to resonate with the public (young girls in particular). At the same time a station such as Capital wants to play music that resonates with its audience, so that they keep listening. That''s probably why <a href="http://comparemyradio.com/artists/The_Wanted" title="">the Wanted have been played a lot</a>. And the reason why Capital <a href=" http://comparemyradio.com/artists/One_Direction" title="">plays a similar act like One Direction (who released a single around the same time as the Wanted) a lot less</a> may very well be that Capital execs don''t believe their audience would like them as much.</p><p>Global''s legal and compliance department says: "Global does not comment on its playlist decisions and are fully compliant with the broadcasting code." But perhaps radio stations that have commercial interests in specific artists could improve transparency by sending each record considered for playlisting to an independent researcher to find out how it fares with test audiences.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/media&k=Radio+industry&k=BBC&k=Radio+1&k=Global+Radio&k=Commercial+radio&k=Media" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+record+industry+needs+to+sort+out+radio+playlist+confusion+Article+1647757&ch=Media&c2=60753&c4=Radio+industry+%28Media%29%2CBBC%2CRadio+1%2CGlobal+Radio%2CCommercial+radio+%28Media%29%2CMedia&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Helienne+Lindvall&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1647757&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: media/organgrinder/2011/oct/16/record-industry-radio-playlist|2011-10-16T21:13:33+01:00|74be9c8410f804a9b3d15f13ae11f882126b026c -->', NULL, 'Media', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:36'),

"Which was very good of them," explained the canon. But then he had asked them if they would leave, "because I didn''t feel that it needed that sort of protection".</p><p>And so those attending Sunday mass found themselves picking a path through the makeshift camp of around 100 tents erected at the foot of the cathedral''s steps after Saturday''s global day of action inspired by the US''s Occupy Wall Street movement.</p><p>With the sermon of the day appropriately including a gospel reading about "God and money", the regular congregation was joined by some of the protesters. The canon had warned them the cathedral bells were "really loud", so it was an early start to their first full day of occupation.</p><p>An attempt on Saturday to set up camp outside the <a href="http://www.londonstockexchange.com/home/homepage.htm" title="">London Stock Exchange</a> in nearby privately-owned Paternoster Square had been thwarted by police. But all the indications on Sunday were that a hard core of dedicated protesters were digging in for the long haul at St Paul''s.</p><p>A field kitchen was being erected, offering basics donated by wellwishers. A first aid point was set up in front of a poster renaming the area as Tahrir Square. A media area, powered by a generator, was aiming to stream activities from the camp live on to the internet. A line of seven portable toilets had also been installed. "Pick up your litter" was one of the continual announcements over the camp''s megaphone.</p><p>A spokesman said the purpose of the occupation was "to challenge the bankers and the financial institutions which recklessly gambled with the economy. This and 20 other occupations all around the UK have been directly inspired by what''s happening all across America and especially in Wall Street."</p><p>Roy Alexander, 39, from Surrey, said: "We''re planning to stay here indefinitely, we''ll stay here and make a stand. I think we''ll have more people join."</p><p>The protest indeed appeared to have struck a chord with many who were new to demonstrating. "I''m 40. Never been on a protest before. But I found myself here," said one man, who asked not to be named, from Sheffield. "I''m pretty middle of the road politically, so I wasn''t sure about all the Socialist Workers placards at first. But this issue has attracted people from all walks of life. I''m a diehard atheist – there''s a woman over there with a ''Jesus is Calling'' placard. It''s all of us."</p><p>Another on his first protest was Ollie Taylor, 23, from Aldershot. "I feel really, really strongly about this issue. I really think it is going to snowball." He, like many others, was having to leave the protest  to return to his job, working in a photographic studio. But many pledged to return.</p><p>Police appeared relaxed, keeping a visible but low-key presence, and chatting and mingling with protesters. It was a different situation on Saturday, when an estimated 3,000-4,000 protesters converged on the cathedral. Supporters claimed a disproportionate amount of force was used and people were "kettled, grabbed and thrown off the steps forcefully".</p><p>The Metropolitan police said some "containment" had been in place to prevent a breach of the peace. Eight people were arrested, of whom six were charged with offences including affray and cannabis possession.</p><p>How long the camp will be allowed to stay remains to be seen. Asked about the impact it would have on businesses in the area, one shop supervisor said: "I can''t imagine the shops in Paternoster Square are too happy about it – they haven''t been able to open since yesterday."</p><p>As for the cathedral''s blessing, the canon stressed that while he had not given specific backing to the occupation of St Paul''s churchyard, he supported the democratic right to protest peacefully. "It''s cold, isn''t it going to be cold tonight?" he said. "We''ll see how it goes. We''re taking one day at a time and it''s really good it''s all worked out well for us today."</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Occupy+London&k=London&k=Occupy+Wall+Street&k=Occupy+movement&k=UK+news&k=Financial+crisis" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Police+told+to+move+along+as+anti-bank+protesters+camp+out+at+St+Paul%27s+Article+1648446&ch=UK+news&c2=60753&c4=Occupy+London%2CLondon+%28News%29%2COccupy+Wall+Street+%28News%29%2COccupy+movement%2CUK+news%2CFinancial+crisis+%28Business%29%2CGlobal+recession%2CBanking+%28Business+sector%29%2CBusiness%2CReligion+%28News%29%2CProtest+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Caroline+Davies&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648446&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2011/oct/16/occupy-london-protest-st-pauls|2011-10-16T21:13:35+01:00|c9017d3f48f8dc17b56fd9a7b66412757327a515 -->', NULL, 'UK news', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:39');

Calls for justice must be heard – otherwise we''ll see a repeat of the riots', '<p>Along Tottenham High Road you cannot help but notice the "I Love Tottenham" stickers emblazoned on every lamppost and in nearly every shop. This is a local-authority-conceived campaign, one that it hopes will bolster community, consumer and investor confidence in the area. As someone who genuinely does love Tottenham I do not wish to undermine the initiative, but it''s impossible not to question the goals of the campaign when the logo gives no insight into why I, or anyone else, should believe in this particular area.</p><p>What does "I love Tottenham" mean to those people who took part in the events of 7 August, which followed the shooting of Mark Duggan by the police? Do they love Tottenham? Well they might do, if you can love somewhere and hate it at the same time.</p><p>For most of those I know who took part, Tottenham is the only home they''ve ever had; some of them have never strayed far from its borders. Far too many have never been outside London. For them it''s where they feel most at ease. But for many it is also a prison. They were born on Tottenham''s estates, and see little chance of escaping. These estates can be desperate places to live.</p><p>I doubt that the "I Love Tottenham" merchandise will make its way on to the estates in any meaningful way. For the residents know this is yet another cosmetic exercise, similar to the spending of £30m on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/08/anger-tottenham-broadwater-riots-1985" title="The Guardian - From the Archive Blog: Anger smoulders in Tottenham: the Broadwater Farm riots of 1985">Broadwater Farm estate</a> in the 1990s. It''s designed to make those who are passing through think that change has occurred when really nothing could be further from the truth. Haringey council and Tottenham''s MP David Lammy have done some good work supporting those who have lost their homes and businesses: for this they should be applauded. But they have shied away from engaging with those whose actions placed Tottenham in the media spotlight once again.</p><p>It''s a reminder of how different it all was in 1985, when <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2000/apr/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries" title="The Guardian - Bernie Grant obituary">Bernie Grant</a> was the leader of Haringey council. Instead of giving the kneejerk reactions we have seen from today''s politicians, he sought to provide a different perspective: he spoke to us before speaking to the media, but most importantly he didn''t say one thing off camera and another thing on camera. That''s why there were no more riots in Tottenham – even after the killings of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/09/ukcrime.gender" title="The Guardian - When the police got it wrong">Joy Gardner in 1993</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2003/oct/22/highereducation.race" title="The Guardian - Our role in racial equality">Roger Sylvester in 1999</a> – while Grant was our MP. There was a feeling that someone in authority cared and would represent their views. Those I speak with today feel no one is remotely interested in hearing their stories, much less willing to represent them.</p><p>Those who are able to speak about the real reasons Tottenham was set ablaze are now finding themselves ignored by the local authority. One well-known reverend, who used to virtually eat, drink and sleep with the council, is no longer invited into the same room after he had the temerity to state publicly that he believed an injustice was being done. The local authority should be listening to him: he has had a glimpse into the lives of those blighted by their policies.</p><p>These actions only add to the sense of isolation and marginalisation that some in Tottenham''s black community have endured for decades. It seems that these politicians have learned little from the expensive public inquiries that they paid for, such as <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/4545/" title="Journal of Social Policy - The Scarman Report, the Macpherson Report and the Media: how newspapers respond to race-centred social policy interventions ">Scarman, Gifford and Macpherson</a>.</p><p>Lammy has told me that Grant''s stance saw Tottenham ostracised by the politicians; but Tottenham had been forgotten long before Bernie became our MP. While he may not have brought the ministerial visits we have seen recently, Lammy shouldn''t think he himself brought them here either: the riots did. And Grant brought us something much more profound than ministers: he brought us hope, gave us pride, and provided us with leadership.</p><p>Martin Luther King once said that riots gave a voice to the voiceless; but the voices of those who felt moved to take to the streets in August are still very much unheard. The lessons from the 80s should tell us that ignoring them will come at a cost.</p><p>These people are the "already marginalised", or the offspring of the "already marginalised": the ones who were excluded from school in disproportionate numbers; who were arrested and convicted under "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sus_law" title="Wikipedia - Sus laws">sus</a>" laws in disproportionate numbers; who are being stopped and searched in disproportionate numbers. They see themselves as victims too: to further marginalise them will only make them feel squeezed between a rock and an even harder place. As far as they are concerned, they are being left with no alternative but to lash out. So telling them that sentences are going to increase is akin to telling someone strapped with a bomb, "Stop or I''ll shoot!"</p><p>I love Tottenham, but it''s the people that make it lovable, not slogans. It will need much more than a sticker campaign if we are to ensure that none of this plays out on our streets again.</p><p>Equality, fairness and justice must be on the table, for without this the regeneration of Tottenham High Road will be meaningless to many of its inhabitants, and the likelihood of another riot erupting will remain a distinct possibility.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=UK+riots&k=Race+issues&k=London&k=Tottenham&k=Mark+Duggan&k=UK+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+voices+of+Tottenham+are+being+marginalised+%7C+Stafford+Scott+Article+1648402&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=60753&c4=UK+riots%2CRace+issues+%28News%29%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CTottenham+News+tag+%28area+of+London%29%2CMark+Duggan%2CUK+news%2CSociety&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Stafford+Scott&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648402&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2011/oct/16/voices-tottenham-marginalised|2011-10-16T21:13:35+01:00|6d2be545a92aa961b63f1c71a1313edbea91f93f -->', NULL, 'Comment is free', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:39'),

I THINK this means that Dave Arch and his orchestra will be leaving David Guetta well alone for a week and putting their ear-bleeding spin on Broadway classics instead.  I guess we can also expect some gratuitous raiding of the props cupboard, and dancing/costumes with a more theatrical flavour.  What joy.  </p><p>It''s probably worth mentioning at this point that I loathe musicals with every fibre in my being, along with lyrical interpretation and fannying about with props and mime and all that jazz.  But this is Strictly, and as @Sharkwald said on Twitter "I''m expecting more camp than a remake of Carry On Camping featuring John Barrowman and Graham Norton".  So put on your legwarmers, form a chorus line and get into the spirit of the occasion *big grin, jazz hands*.</p><p>The GOOD news for this evening is there''s more variation on the dancing – we''ve got the full mix of waltzes, latin, quickstep, foxtrot and tango, which makes it all a bit more interesting.  AND the departure of Edwina last week means the show is ten minutes shorter, so we can finally be grateful to her for something.  </p><p>I''ll be here from 6.25pm to document every tassel, twirl and trodden toe – do join me in the comment box with your thoughts and opinions – they are invariably the best bit.</p><p>See you later!</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.19pm:</span> Just watching the end of Celebrity Masterchef.

That was ill-advised, it''s all gone a bit shambolic.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.31pm:</span> Here come Sir Bruce and Tess!  Tess''s dress has a horrible pair of lace knickers sewn into the front, and something appears to be nesting in her hair.  She is promising us razzle, and also dazzle.  I''ll just take the dazzle, thanks.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.33pm:</span> Here come the celebs - eyes peeled for horrid frocks!  Chelsee''s obsession with fringe continues, whereas Holly appears to be wearing bondage gear and Anita has been at the dressing up box.  AGAIN.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.36pm:</span> First up it''s <strong>Holly and Artem</strong>!  They are dancing the tango to ''Cell Block Tango'' from Chicago.  This is a musical I have actually seen! </p><p>Out they come - Holly is in a jail cell looking like Elvira Mistress of the Dark.  Loving her black wig though.  </p><p>Her tango is big on character, but still a bit spongy - she can certainly dance, but it''s all a bit...floppy, somehow.  It was all fine until she got out of the cage.  Also Holly and Artem have no chemistry at ALL, something that was very apparent from the start with Kara and Artem last year.  I also wish he''d stop wearing mesh vests.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.39pm:</span> What do the judges thing of Holly and Artem''s tango?  Len thought is was full of smolder, and he loved it.  Alesha though it lacked intensity, but she got Bruno going.  Craig liked the storytelling, but her tango needed to be cleaner and sharper.  I concur.</p><p>Scores - 7 from Craig, 8 from Len, 7 from Alesha and 8 from Bruno - a total of 30.  Great start for Holly and Artem, only 12 couples to go!</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.44pm:</span> Next up is <strong>Dan and Katya</strong>!</p><p>This week they are dancing the Viennese waltz, inexplicably to Queen''s ''Somebody To Love'' from We Will Rock You.  OK, we''ll go with it, but it better not spoil the Viennese waltz, it''s my favourite.   </p><p>Out they come - Dan wearing a horrible leather waistcoat, and Katya managing to rock electric blue in a way that Edwina entirely failed to do last week.</p><p>Oh Dan, Dan.  You know I adore you.  But you look like the coat hanger is still jammed in your shirt, and your teeth are gritted.  It''s just not very...romantic, is it?</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.48pm:</span> Judges'' verdict - needs a bit more fluidity, and he didn''t really capture the magic and intensity of the song.  Craig though he was awkward, and by the end he didn''t have a neck.  That''ll be the coat hanger.  Len thought it was difficult because Dan is tall.  Lots of men are tall, Len.  It''s the nature of men.</p><p>Scores - 5 from Craig, 7 from Len, 6 from Alesha and 6 from Bruno - total of 24 for Dan and Katya.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.52pm:</span> Next up is <strong>Anita and Robin!</strong>.  They are dancing the Jive  to ''You Can''t Stop The Beat'' from Hairspray.  I have never seen Hairspray.  It looks awful.</p><p>Out they come.  Anita is dressed like a pink doll, the sort that wee on demand and cry when you turn them upside down.  Alas, neither of these things happen.  There are props, and pinkness, and stompy jiving, and Anita grinning maniacally.  Never mind the beat, wish someone would stop Anita Dobson.  I suspect heavy machinery couldn''t stop her.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.56pm:</span> Judges verdict - not precise enough, too loose and messy, but according to Len "fun, energetic and entertaining".  Yes, and so are CLOWNS.  And they are still SCARY.</p><p>Scores time!  6 from Craig, 7 from Len, 7 from Alesha and 7 from Bruno - total of 27 for Anita and Robin.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><span class="timestamp">6.58pm:</span> Are we there yet?  Ah, apparently not.  Another ten to go.  Next up is <strong>Alex and James!</strong> They are dancing a Viennese Waltz  to ''Memory'' from the musical Cats.  </p><p>Neither of them is dressed in a cat costume, disappointingly, although someone in the orchestra is wailing like a kitten stuck in a tumble dryer.  Alex''s dress is mostly lilac netting, and she has Elaine Paige''s hair.</p><p>Oh, this is MUCH more like it.  It''s all proper romantic and floaty, as a Viennese Waltz should be.  I don''t care what the judges say, I LOVED that.  More please.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.03pm:</span> Craig loved it, although he would have liked it to have been a little more daring.  Len thought it was beautiful, and Bruno bangs on about birds taking flight.  I think he likes it.  Hard to know with Bruno sometimes.  He''s a giant complex metaphor.</p><p>Scores - eights all round, a total of 32.  Great dance from Alex, this evening is LOOKING UP.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.06pm:</span> Right, I''m all warmed up now.  Who''s next?  It''s It''s <strong>Rory and Erin</strong>!  Tonight they are dancing the Quickstep to ''Top Hat, White Tie and Tails'' from Top Hat.  </p><p>Rory has the tails, the top hat and the cane - so many things to trip over. Erin is wearing a Christmas fairy light curtain attached to a dead swan.</p><p>Rory is actually very good - from where I''m sitting, his footwork looks excellent, albeit his top half looks a bit stiff.  Or maybe it''s supposed to be like that?</p><p>Well, I rather enjoyed that.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.10pm:</span> Len loved it - Rory''s best dance so far.  Lots of razzle and dazzle, and Rory held his character to the end.  Which of course is what Rory does.  Craig thought his hands were flat and his posture wasn''t great, but full of panache nonetheless.</p><p>"Here comes the quickstepper" says Tess, clearly trying to be down with the kidz.  The kidz aren''t watching, Tess, but I''m with you. </p><p>7 from Craig, and 8s from the others - a total of 31.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.13pm:</span> Next up is <strong>Lulu and Brendan</strong>!  Tonight they are dancing the Rumba to ''All I Ask Of You'' from Phantom of the Opera.  All Brendan asks of Lulu is that she follows the steps, and doesn''t fall over.  It shouldn''t be too much to ask, should it?</p><p>In training, Lulu is crying, because she isn''t elegant and can''t do it.  To help her, Brendan makes her wear an Andrew Lloyd-Webber mask.  Yes, that''ll do it.</p><p>Lulu is wearing a Halloween costume, but somehow makes it look good.  Brendan is flapping a cape about, and mouthing the words.   The singing is awful, but the dancing is all quite...sensual, which in the context of Lulu and Brendan is all a bit disturbing.  But isn''t the rumba a latin dance? Why are they wafting about to Phantom? I''m confused.  Also, I know nothing.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.17pm:</span> Judges verdict - a good effort from Lulu, who is improving every week.  But Brendan put in an illegal lift and Craig plans to penalise him for it.  Handbags at dawn!</p><p>Scores are in - 5 from Craig and 7s from the others - a total of 26.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.21pm:</span> Next up it''s <strong>Nancy and Anton!</strong> They are dancing the Tango  to ''Be Italian'' from Nine.  This is a musical I have never heard of.  </p><p>Out they come - Nancy looks every inch the flamenco vixen in a scarlet toilet brush.  Clearly she is trying to compensate for her lack of dancing ability by sitting on a chair and flashing her legs.  She also looks a bit drunk, if I''m honest.  GO Nancy.</p><p>Now, as tangos go, this looks alright to me, but what do I know.  Clearly this is much more Nancy''s cup of tea, albeit a spiked cup.  I mean she''s still rubbish and her feet and arms are all over the shop, but it''s better.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.25pm:</span> Nancy and Bruce do a horrible routine about her being invited to Bruce''s dressing room.  A nation cringes.  Anton looks like he''s had enough.</p><p>Bruno enjoyed it, but Craig thought she was a "plodding mule".  Ooh, harsh. Len thought there was lots of style, but no substance.  </p><p>Scores for Nancy - 4 from Craig, 5 from Len, 5 from Alesha and 6 from Bruno - a total of 20.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.29pm:</span> Who''s next?  It''s Audley and Natalie!  He has size 17 feet, in case you didn''t know.  They are dancing the Samba  to ''Too Darn Hot'' from Kiss Me Kate.  They do their training in a Bikram yoga studio.  It''s hot, see?  Nope, me neither.</p><p>Out they come - Audley is dressed like a professional snooker player, and Natalie is dressed like a belly dancer.  Is this what Kiss Me Kate is about?</p><p>It''s all a bit...shuffly, and he keeps tripping over his own feet.  Audley''s doing his best, bless him, but dancefloor hotness is not something he has in excess.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.33pm:</span> Craig though Audley''s timing was out, but Audley was lighter of foot than he expected.  However his feet still need work, and he needs more spring in his step.</p><p>Oh god, are they going to talk about how big Audley''s feet are until Christmas?  It''s only week 2, it''s getting boring now.</p><p>Scores - 5 from Craig, 6 from Len and Alesha, and 7 from Bruno - total of 24.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.35pm:</span> I think there are only 5 left - stick with me!  Next up it''s <strong>Robbie and Ola</strong>!  They are dancing the Tango to ''Gimme, Gimme, Gimme'' from Mama Mia.  I''m sure the Broadway purists are grinding their teeth at the choice of such populist numbers, but I suspect this may be for philistines like me.  I''ve seen the film, does that count?  </p><p>Robbie has greased his hair back, and has got his guns out.  His tango intensity stare is horrible, as is his tango. He bum is sticking out in a most unpleasant manner, making him tango like a chicken.</p><p>I can also report that Dave Arch''s orchestra is singing this song marginally less competently than Meryl Streep.  Or was it Julie Walters?  I forget.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.39pm:</span> Len thought it was full of attack and aggression, and a good effort.  Alesha loved it - really?  Bruno just needs to stop, it''s giving me a headache.  Even Craig liked it.  Was I watching something else?  Or is the tango supposed to look like that?</p><p>Scores - 7s from Craig and Len, 8s from Alesha and Bruno - a total of 30.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.42pm:</span> It''s time for <strong>Russell and Flavia</strong>!  They are dancing the Foxtrot to ''Rain On My Parade'' from Funny Girl.  </p><p>Russell gives the distinct impression of someone who has found his spiritual home – forget all that astrology rubbish, he''s all about the ballroom.   I have to say it makes him far more appealing than when he was wearing terrible knitwear and babbling on about the moon being in Jupiter.  </p><p>Tonight he is wearing white tails and a white top hat, which makes him look like Willy Wonka, whereas Flavia''s yellow dress and tan combination make her look like a banana on the turn.  Russell is splendidly light of foot and doing a very decent foxtrot.  He''s clearly having a ball, is great to watch, and I love him.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.47pm:</span> The judges loved it, apart from Craig who would have preferred a more "masculine approach".  Hahaha.  Pot, have you met kettle?</p><p>Scores - 6 from Craig, 7 from Len, 7 from Alesha and 8 from Bruno - a total of 28.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.50pm:</span> Well, that was fun.  Now it''s time for <strong>Jason and Kristina!</strong>  They are dancing the Tango to ''I Will Survive'' from Priscilla Queen of the Desert – familiar territory for Ja-Do, who has starred in this in the West End.  Can he do a manly tango?</p><p>Also, does Kristina own any dresses that cover her torso?  This one is so pink it hurts.  It''s also the most un-butch tango I''ve ever seen - he might has well have done it in a rainbow cape and heels.  His footwork is excellent, but suddenly it''s goes all disco.  I DON''T UNDERSTAND.</p><p>Also, tango-ing to Gloria Gaynor should be BANNED FOR ALL ETERNITY.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.54pm:</span> The judges loved the manly/camp/manly combo.  Oh, I have no idea what to think any more.</p><p>Scores - 9s all round - an impressive 36 for Jason, who is rapidly lining up to be the favourite in this competition.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.56pm:</span> THERE ARE ONLY TWO LEFT!  YAY!  Don''t turn over to X Factor, nothing happens for the first 15 minutes anyway.</p><p>Next up it''s <strong>Chelsee and Pasha!</strong> They are dancing the Cha Cha to ''Beggin'' from Jersey Boys.   The singing is an all-time low, and Chelsee''s hair seems to get bigger by the week.   I''m beggin'' her to put an outfit on that doesn''t involve fringing. </p><p>Chelsee''s cha cha looks great - really sharp footwork and she''s clearly having a ball. LOVED THAT.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.00pm:</span> Craig thought she had great timing and energy, but it was haphazard and a bit disco.  She needs more precision, but she''s got loads of potential.  I really enjoy watching her dance, at least she''s never boring.</p><p>Scores - 6 from Craig, 8 from Len, 8 from Alesha and 8 from Bruno - a very solid 30 for Chelsee.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.03pm:</span> Last, but definitely not least, it''s It''s <strong>Harry and Aliona!</strong> They are dancing the jive to ''Grease Lightning'' from Grease – another musical I have actually seen in its stage form.  The only thing I remember is going to the ladies during the interval and inadvertently smacking actress Jane Seymour in the face with a door.</p><p>Anyway, Harry''s chest is out.  That is all you need to know, costume-wise.  His jiving is also pretty decent too, but that''s almost by the by.  My only issue is that there seemed to be very little actual jiving.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.07pm:</span> The judges enjoyed it, but would have liked less messing about.  Me too.  Bruno is perving and I wish he''d stop.  Craig is too, but is at least more subtle about it.</p><p>Scores for Harry and his lovely chest - 8 from Craig, 8 from Len, 9 from Alesha and 8 from Bruno - a total of 33.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.10pm:</span> So that''s it for tonight - Jason is at the top for the third week in a row, with Nancy at the bottom.  I hope she goes this week, the theatricals are getting on my nerves and I fear for Anton''s sanity.  </p><p>Thanks for all your comments once again - I''ll be back here tomorrow for the results show at 7.25, so join me then to find out who''s leaving the dancefloor for good!  See you then!</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>*RESULTS SHOW UPDATE!*</strong></p><p>It''s time to find out who''s going home!  It''s only half an hour, hang on in there.  Then you can pop over to the other side for X Factor.  Stu Heritage is also doing a brilliant liveblog.</p><p>The pros are dancing to "America" from West Side Story.  This is a musical I know!  My dad had the album and played it to death throughout my childhood.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.28pm:</span> See, all the girls have got nice, sensible, body-covering outfits on, and they look fabulous.  Why do we have to be subjected to such horrors on a Saturday night?</p><p>Talking of horrors, Tess is wearing a cream one-shouldered dress adorned with cheap-looking sparkly rubbish.  How has her stylist not been fired?  Claudia is channelling Mystic Meg.  Perhaps she''s going into business with Russell.</p><p>Ah, the interminable recap of last night *goes to make tea*.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.34pm:</span> So who''s staying and who''s going?  Well Audley''s definitely not in the bottom two, which I think is good news.</p><p>First person in the bottom two - Dan and Katya!  The lovely Dan Lobb!  How can it be?</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.38pm:</span> The stars of the new Footloose movie have jetted in to perform.  I remember the original film with the fondness of youth.  I''m sure if I watched it now it would be terrible.</p><p>Mostly male dancer is throwing female dancer about like a beanbag.  He''s no Kevin Bacon, is he?  Oh, thank god.  It''s all livened up a bit.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.42pm:</span> What IS Claudia wearing?  It appears to be a black poncho/cape affair.  Is her entire wardrobe Halloween costumes? </p><p>Brace yourself for Len''s Lens.  It may be pointless filler, but at least it''s alliterative.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.47pm:</span> Right, time to find out who''s the other person in the bottom two.  Has Tess been borrowing lipstick off 2 Shoes?</p><p>Ooh, Lulu''s not in the bottom two!  Which sort of rhymes.</p><p>It''s Nancy!  She''s in the bottom two with Dan.  Of course it should be Dan that stays, when do they start doing the dance-off thing?</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.51pm:</span> Just when you thought this show couldn''t get any more tedious, it''s Susan Boyle singing Unchained Melody.  I never thought the day would come when I''d long for Robson &amp; Jerome.</p><p>Susan is hungering for someone''s touch.  Let''s consider that for a while.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.54pm:</span> Nancy would be sad to leave.  Anton is trying to look sad, but I suspect that inside he''s singing the Hallelujah Chorus.</p><p>So who''s leaving?  *crosses fingers for Nancy* - it''s <strong>DAN AND KATYA!</strong> This makes me sad.  I can only assume that the nation has decided to punish him for that leather waistcoat.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.58pm:</span> So that''s another week of Strictly over – two contestants down, 12 to go (eek!).  Thanks again for joining in with all your comments – I''ll be back here next week for some more dancefloor action.  In the meantime you can follow me on Twitter @heidistephens.  See you next week!

Does that&nbsp;mean retailers are now paying attention to older women?</strong></p><p><em>Sharon, New York</em></p><p></p><p>It would be nice to think that, wouldn''t it? And who knows, maybe they are, or at least maybe they are finally realising that older women tend to have more money than the anorexic Russian teenagers to whom they usually seem to be trying to appeal, judging from the women they use in their adverts. True, the fact that Demi has admitted to having had plastic surgery somewhat undermines the idea that the fashion industry is developing healthier ideas of how women look, but no matter.</p><p>So well done to American retailers <a href="http://fashion.elle.com/fashion/2011/08/02/julianne-demis-fall-campaign-face-off/" title="">Ann Taylor and Talbots for hiring Demi Moore and Julianne Moore</a>, although maybe they just hired them for their last name as opposed to their maturity and beauty. Apparently, there is a huge untapped market out there for women whose surname is "Moore".</p><p>Now, if I were a true professional I&nbsp;would see <a href="http://www.wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/susan-sarandon-one-of-many-in-uniqlos-fall-campaign-5108517?src=rss/recentstories/20110906" title="">Uniqlo''s signing of Susan Sarandon</a> as even more of a triumph. Talbots does aim at a somewhat older market, so for it to use older models, while commendable, is not actually that mould-breaking. Uniqlo, however, aims primarily, if not solely, at a younger generation, so using 64-year-old Sarandon in its adverts really is an impressive step. Or it would be, were I&nbsp;a professional.</p><p>You see, to be a true professional journalist, one should tuck one''s emotions away and merely report on the story itself. Facts, dear boy, facts, and all that. But I''m afraid I ... cannot ... hold … in … any … more! My God, I just cannot <em>bear</em> Sarandon.</p><p>She is a very fine actor and quite possibly one of the sexiest women ever born, and yet instead of cheering on this sexy sixtysomething, whenever I&nbsp;see her step up to a podium to give an award to someone, I just want to claw my own ears off my head. Like Sean Penn and Helen Hunt, Sarandon has always come across as so spectacularly humourless, sanctimonious and lacking in self-awareness that no matter how I try to like her, I end up scratching away at my lobes.</p><p>I used to feel guilty about this. After all, irrational hatred of celebrities one has never even met is surely one of the great ills of the modern day, along with internet-induced ADD and flavoured coffees. But then, about two years ago, I happened to see Ms Sarandon walking up the red carpet to, if memory serves, the Oscars when she was stopped by the star of E! himself, Ryan Seacrest. At first, Sarandon did her usual shtick, solemnly lecturing E!''s audience about, if memory is still serving, the victims in Haiti, a very commendable thing to lecture on. When Seacrest then told her they didn''t have much time left, she hastily switched subjects to detailing where each part of her outfit had come from, taking special care to give a shout to her jewellers, banging on about her earrings for veritable yonks. Well, you gotta please the advertisers and fashion press offices, right? Oh, Sarandon. Go off and wrap yourself in some colourful knitwear and don''t hit your sexy butt on the way out, girlfriend.</p><p></p><p><strong>OK, so you established that </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/09/anna-wintour-kanye-west-vogue" title=""><strong>Anna  Wintour probably didn''t like Kanye West''s fashion line</strong></a><strong> last week – but what do you think?</strong></p><p><em>Marcus, by email</em></p><p></p><p>Again, I shall reveal my unprofessional nature. Kanye West wrote possibly <a href="http://youtu.be/qLnS-2h_nog" title="">the worst rhyme in modern music</a> – "Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh/Put the pussy in a sarcophagus/Now she claiming that I bruised her esophogus" – and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/oct/12/kanye-west-occupy-wall-street" title="">I still love him</a>, so some bad clothes aren''t going to bother me too&nbsp;much.</p><p>In my Anchorman-obsessed mind, Kanye is the Steve Carell to Jay-Z''s Will Ferrell, the id to the world''s super ego. This is a man who just does and says exactly what he wants and when he wants, and then spends the next two years writing songs about how sorry he&nbsp;is.</p><p>Thus, West''s collection was a predictable mish-mash of designers he admires and overly sexy clothes that he probably saw on the web at 3am the night before. And in all honesty, I would not want it any other way. The man is a talented enough musician. It would be downright weird if he became the next Martin Margiela, too, because that would at least suggest he wasn''t actually designing the clothes himself. But one look at those bandage dresses and frankly bonkers shoes tells you, yup, this is definitely the work of West.</p><p></p><p><em>• Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

In 2011 his compliment works less well – on  current evidence it would be about a  morning''s work.</p><p>Last week Matt  Cardle released a Barlow composition called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coCwyRhb_2A" title="">Run  For Your Life</a>. Next month  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/03/britains-got-talent-ronan-parke" title="">controversial Britain''s Got Talent mini-man Ronan Parke''s</a> album will also include a new Barlow tune (Stronger Than I), and Westlife''s next single, Lighthouse, is yet another new song from the Barlow catalogue. Impressive stuff, particularly as Take That''s last album is just 11 months old, and an extra eight-song bonus album came out in May. But there''s more: having helmed (and looked very serious in the video for) this year''s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIwTcA60BkE" title="">Children in Need single</a>, Barlow will also give yet another <a href="http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/the-x-factor/333412-the-x-factor-gary-barlow-winners-song" title="">brand new song</a> to the next X Factor winner.</p><p>"How does he do it?" is a fair question and, based on that Matt Cardle single, "by not always  exercising  rigorous quality control" seems like a suitable answer. It''s certainly true that the quality of the songs he has donated to those less fortunate has varied in quality almost as wildly as that of the artists themselves. (In recent years he has also provided songs for, among others, John Barrowman and Peter Kay''s comedy creation Geraldine McQueen.)</p><p>Perhaps during his wilderness years Barlow behaved <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hKHEbznw3NPseKUZkbkfExliR85Q?docId=N0839291318144378765A" title="">as if nothing was wrong</a>, like the sacked stockbroker who leaves for work each morning then spends his day on a park bench next to an empty briefcase. The idea of Barlow diligently penning an album''s worth of new material in time for non-release every Christmas for eight years would certainly explain the song mountain being slowly dismantled in 2011.</p><p>But the crucial point was  Simon Cowell deciding, with the arrival of X Factor USA, to go on holiday and leave Barlow not just babysitting Louis Walsh, but with the keys to the pop kingdom. To most pop stars this would signify party time. Gary "sensibleface" Barlow, remembering those years spent reading Take a Break on the park bench, knew this was his chance to make himself indispensable, and cast himself as the "Simon Cowell it''s OK to like", even though he''s still a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7597261/General-Election-2010-Gary-Barlow-unveiled-as-David-Cameron-backer.html" title="">very big Tory supporter</a>.</p><p>After the X Factor winner''s single, the Children in Need tune and all the rest, I''m actually warming to the idea of Barlow as pop laureate. It makes sense for there to be an inspirational Barlow-ballad for every occasion, whether it''s a Eurovision song contest that needs winning, a royal couple requiring a first dance or a World Cup squad demanding an anthem. It''s just amazing that the 2012 Olympics have so far escaped a Barlow-penned allstar singalong. "Team GB" has a bit of a ring to it, don''t you think?</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/culture&k=Gary+Barlow&k=The+X+Factor&k=Pop+and+rock" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/culture/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/culture/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Gary+Barlow%3A+the+one-man+songwriting+factory+Article+1647833&ch=Culture&c2=60753&c4=Gary+Barlow%2CX+Factor+%28TV+and+radio%29%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Peter+Robinson&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1647833&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: culture/2011/oct/16/gary-balow-songwriting|2011-10-16T21:13:35+01:00|3d8ec74d29e0e7f1c8fd3a6db38bffde784f1e63 -->', NULL, 'Culture', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:39'),

Even back in the 90s, when Jarvis Cocker was the star of the Britpop band Pulp, everyone used to say he looked like a geography teacher – and he certainly looks less like a pop star than some of the teachers crowding round him in the staff room.</p><p>Cocker had returned to his old school to launch his book, Mother, Brother, Lover – a compilation of song lyrics spanning 30 years. In the assembly hall he stood on the stage where Pulp – then a bunch of schoolmates he''d harangued into forming a band – performed their very first gig in 1978. Because the band was his idea, he explained, he had been lumbered with writing the lyrics, and he sang a pretty dreadful early example – "She said, To be or not to be? Shakespeare rock, Shakespeare roll. Shakespeare rock, Shakespeare roll." A hall full of teenagers tittered with embarrassment.</p><p>Writing songs, he agreed, can be embarrassing. "So you either try to make people laugh, and make out you don''t really mean it – or you try to sum up the entire universe in a single song." But all you really need to do, he said, is write about your own experience. The everyday lives of Sheffield schoolchildren are just as rich and interesting as anything they see on TV or get off the internet. "And that''s my main message, really. Don''t think that the things around you don''t count, because they do."</p><p>Afterwards, staff queued up with their old Pulp CDs for him to sign. One had an original copy of the Sorted for E''s and Wizz hit single, whose i<a href="http://www.pulpwiki.net/Pulp/SortedSingleArtwork" title="">nfamous sleeve featured instructions on how to fold a wrap to keep drugs in</a>. I''d clean forgotten Cocker was once the voice of youth drug culture – and I suspect the kids he''d just addressed would be astonished – for these days he''s more like the heir to Alan Bennett. He has curated a cultural festival at the Southbank Centre, made <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/may/12/jarvis-cocker-national-trust-album" title="">field recordings for the National Trust</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/4d8a4hqYs1A" title="">appeared on Question Time</a>, hosted a Channel 4 arts series, and currently presents <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ptsjd" title="">an unusually cerebral Sunday show on BBC''s 6 Music</a>, whose recent escape from closure owed much to Cocker''s advocacy. This summer Pulp reformed to play at a few festivals, where they were received like royalty, and last week his publisher, Faber &amp; Faber, announced <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/oct/12/pulp-jarvis-cocker-editor-faber" title="">his appointment as editor-at-large</a>, confirming his quiet evolution from drug-gobbling pop star to Renaissance man of arts.</p><p>When we get on the train back to London, he looks tired. "I haven''t slept for the last few nights," he admits, on account of nerves about going back to school. "I was super nervous, yeah. I''m always nervous when I perform anyway. But you know, we all regress when we go back to school – you''ve got lots of weird memories of school. I&nbsp;wasn''t bullied, but it was fairly – well, a bit rough."</p><p>His smile is slow and so shy as to seem almost sly, and he speaks softly, making little eye contact. He has a habit of half rolling his eyes back as he shakes his fringe off his forehead, which I suspect is an affectation he adopted long ago to disguise awkwardness, and he still seems slightly uneasy at being interviewed. "Well it''s a while since I have been," he grins – but once we start talking about his book he begins to relax.</p><p>Lyrics, he says, aren''t actually all that important to songs. "Words are important to me, but a song can work and function and be a good song with words that are fairly standard. But really great lyrics can''t rescue a dog of a song. I find that quite a lot now that I''m doing the radio show. I get sent quite a lot of records and if I''m on the way back from the programme sometimes there''s a lyric sheet, and I''ll read something and think, oh, that sounds pretty good, and I get quite excited about listening to it when I get home. And then I''ll put it on and I''ll be like – eurghhh."</p><p>Cocker''s own lyric writing has always been anchored in the narrative of his everyday life, finding wit and drama in the mundane details of an overheard conversation, say, or a rainy bus ride. But pop has moved on a long way since Pulp''s 1995 hit <a href="http://youtu.be/DqgXzPfAxjo" title="">Common People</a> – the mocking tale of a rich girl who enjoys pretending to be poor – became what music critics like to call the anthem of the Britpop generation. So I show him the lyrics of the current top three singles, to see what he makes of this generation''s.</p><p>"Oh, I wouldn''t even know what they were," he says at once, apologetically. "I&nbsp;feel bad, because I used to be right into the charts. I stopped when it got too predictable. They killed it when they discovered that formula, where a single would be half price in the week that it was released, so all singles started selling loads in the first week and then dropping off. It stops that thing of a record building – the first week was always the highest – and then it wasn''t interesting at all. It''s a good picture of what capitalism does. They find a formula that kills off the thing they''re trying to make money out of." Does he apply the same rule to – and I was going to say "technology", thinking of iPods and illegal downloading, but he interrupts softly. "Everything. It''s what capitalism does to everything."</p><p>I show him the first lyric sheet – <a href="http://youtu.be/-d6b1yn-YhQ" title="">Loca People by Sak Noel</a>, featuring a comic mixture of Spanish and profanity. "So this is No 1, is it? Right." He scans the page. "That''s pretty good actually. It''s kind of funny. I''d say it was vaguely educational, cos you pick up a little bit of Spanish." Next up is <a href="http://youtu.be/iEPTlhBmwRg" title="">Moves Like Jagger, by&nbsp;Maroon Five</a>.</p><p>"As a title it''s OK, but that''s the only interesting thing in the lyrics, I would say. Maybe they work with the song, but it''s all those words – nice, smile, right. There are just certain song words&nbsp;that just work nicely in songs, like heart and stars, they just kind of sound right. So it''s just like a list of all those words put together, with a swear word and a reasonable title." He&nbsp;slides it back across the table and grins. "Must try harder."</p><p>Has he heard of the next one, <a href="http://youtu.be/NdYWuo9OFAw" title="">Iris by Goo Goo Dolls</a>? He gives a blank look, has a read, and shakes his head in despair. "I wouldn''t be surprised if that had been written by a lyrics generator on the internet or something like that. ''You bleed just to know you''re alive''? I mean, really."</p><p>Cocker says he began writing bittersweet songs in his teens about awkwardness and disappointment because he wanted his life to have a soundtrack he could relate to. His own inept romantic disasters bore little resemblance to the saccharine love songs of commercial pop – so he wrote his own. I could be wrong, but his teenage audience in Sheffield didn''t look to me like they were any more sophisticated than the adolescent Cocker – but judging from the charts, they don''t seem to want the sort of songs he longed for at their age. Why does he think they prefer boastful rappers talking rubbish about bling, to lyrics they might actually relate to?</p><p>''Well, I''ve thought about that, you know. And maybe they just get that from somewhere else," he says mildly. "In a way it doesn''t matter where it comes from, does it? You probably get it off Facebook now or something, I don''t know. To look for some kind of insight or meaning in pop&nbsp;songs is not really – well there''s plenty of other places where you should probably look first before you start looking for it in a pop song. I guess it was just because I was really into music as a child, and I wanted it to say more. It was the thing, wasn''t it? And now it isn''t.</p><p>"Music''s changed in that way. People still listen to it, but it''s not as central, it''s more like a scented candle. It sets the mood. Also, because people like to multitask, in a way if you''ve got a bit of music on in the background and the lyrical content is making you want to listen to it, then that would probably put you off the texting you wanted to do. I think people like things that just make that right kind of noise, but leave your brain free to do something else."</p><p>He offers this without any hint of regret – but I get the feeling that''s only because he doesn''t want to appear judgmental. "I can''t operate that way at all, no," he concedes. "I can''t even go in pubs that have TVs on, it''s horrible."</p><p>What he did share with today''s teenagers was a longing for fame. Born into a lower-middle-class family in 1963, he was the archetypal arty misfit – insecure, shortsighted, "a little bit different". As is so often the way, he thought becoming famous would be the solution, and pursued that dream throughout the 80s, but after 10 years Pulp was still just a jobbing Yorkshire band with a modest cult following. He gave up, moved to London to study film at St Martins – and suddenly began writing better songs. Britpop came along, <a href="http://youtu.be/hfdxfjokAdY" title="">by 1995 Pulp were headlining Glastonbury</a> and Cocker was a superstar – at which point he quickly discovered he didn''t like being famous at all. After a few years of the usual cliches – <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/24/jarvis-cocker-pulp-pop-music" title="">groupies and cocaine, chatshows and excess</a> – creative inspiration dried up, and in 2002 the band called it a day.</p><p>I ask why he thinks his own particular childhood longing for fame has become the universal ambition of almost every teenager today. Does it mean that all youngsters now feel as he did then – inadequate and insignificant?</p><p>"I think basically becoming famous has taken the place of going to heaven in modern society, hasn''t it? That''s the place where your dreams will come true. It''s an act of faith now; they think&nbsp;that''s going to sort things out." When he talked to the children he contrasted X Factor''s fantasy of overnight stardom with the 15 years'' work it took Pulp to be successful – but presumably he too must have heard cautionary tales about the false promise of celebrity when he was a child. So why didn''t he heed them?</p><p>"Ah," he smiles, "I think everybody always thinks they''re cleverer than everyone else, and they wouldn''t fall into those traps."</p><p>The likelihood of any child at his old&nbsp;school getting the chance to find out for themselves is in reality, of course, remote – far more so than when Cocker was a pupil. Experimental bands such as Pulp were the product of a particular era when aspiring musicians could go on the dole, live in a council flat, study for free at art school, and develop their craft. Has that path now closed for good?</p><p>"Well, I hope not. But going to St Martins – if I hadn''t gone there we probably wouldn''t have turned into the band we did. I really think the art schools won''t survive now – nobody''s going to pay 30 grand just on spec, and I think there really needs to be a concerted effort to make them exempt from the fees, because basically a lot of people who would''ve gone won''t now. So yeah, sometimes you do feel like a dinosaur, cos you''ve come through a system that doesn''t exist any more, and that''s kind of why I wanted to go and talk at the school, I suppose. I''m not meaning in a real ale kind of Keep Music Live way, I''m not really bothered about that. What I''m saying is it just stops creativity coming from that kind of background. I actually think that background has more vitality."</p><p>Compared with? "Well it has changed now. The big rock bands now&nbsp;are from slightly monied or privileged backgrounds." He''s right about that; in 1990 just 2% of artists in the UK top 10 had been to public school. In October 2010 it was 60%. "I don''t want to turn it all into a class war thing," he says quickly. "Maybe they''ve got more to prove. Maybe they think, I''ve got to prove I''m not just a well-to-do toff. So I''ve got to create something." Or maybe, I suggest, they''re now the only ones who can afford to have a go.</p><p>"Well that''s why I''m glad I went to the school today, cos you can get into that grumpy old man mindset – everything''s fucked, it''s not like it was in my day, or whatever. But you know, in my day I was on the dole – so what kind of day was that, really? Let''s not forget, the 80s in Sheffield were fucking awful – certainly not halcyon days. You can get into that thing of everything''s going downhill. You know, it''s not like everything is irredeemably, irretrievably fucked. I think it''s good to realise that, you know?"</p><p>There was a time when it looked as if Cocker''s life might be going if not quite downhill then adrift. After Pulp he married a French stylist, Camille Bidault-Waddington, moved to Paris and had a son, Albert, now eight, and tried to recover a sense of normality and anonymity. At 40 he had decided he was too old to perform – but then worried that he wasn''t much use at anything else – so he released some solo records, but they weren''t terribly good, and in 2009 his marriage ended. He now divides his time between Paris and London, and is gradually getting accustomed to his new public identity as a national treasure.</p><p>"Well it''s nice that people say that," he says, smiling gently. "It does make you sound as if you need dusting, but it would be worse if I was called a national disgrace."</p><p>Some did call him a national disgrace when <a href="http://youtu.be/dZEWomOQVno" title="">he invaded the stage at the Brit awards in 1996</a>, in protest at Michael Jackson''s messianic performance. And in truth, I was never that keen on art school pop stars myself back then. I found them a bit pretentious; too arch and fey for their own good. If I''d had any idea they''d be displaced by the cynical Muzak which passes for pop nowadays, I''d have felt very differently, and I find myself desperately hoping his words had an impact on the children at his old school.</p><p>At the end of his talk there, he took questions. "What famous people have you met?" a boy called out. Quite a lot, said Cocker – why not name some, and I''ll tell you if I''ve met them? The boy thought for a second, and called out the first name he could think of.</p><p>"Have you met Simon Cowell?"</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Jarvis+Cocker&k=Music&k=Pop+and+rock&k=Culture" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Jarvis+Cocker%3A+%27Music+has+changed.+It%27s+not+as+central%2C+it%27s+more+like+a+scented+candle%27+Article+1648110&ch=Music&c2=60753&c4=Jarvis+Cocker%2CMusic%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Decca+Aitkenhead&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648110&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2011/oct/16/jarvis-cocker-interview|2011-10-16T21:13:38+01:00|1900da0b2b0a2ccc9db32fb102d146bbd9c8d728 -->', NULL, 'Music', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:41'),

Entitled Tintin and Alph-Art, the story hinged on an evil scheme to abduct Tintin and encase him in liquid polyester. The gallant boy reporter would therefore become a "living sculpture", beautiful but dead. "Your corpse will be displayed in a museum," the villain (according to Hergé''s notes) would cackle. "And no one will suspect that the work constitutes the last resting place of Tintin."</p><p>Three decades on, this dastardly plot may just have been completed. Out of the blocks comes The Adventures of Tintin, a rip-snorting Indiana Jones-style romp from directorSteven Spielberg, darting from the cobbled streets of Paris to the bazaars and hill towns of north Africa in search of buried treasure. On the face of it, all is well. But look closely at the film''s protagonists, with their strange vestigial features and blank, marbled gaze, and one comes to suspect that here, at last, is the version of Alph-Art we assumed would never see the light of day.</p><p>Officially speaking, The Adventures of Tintin is a conflation of three antique Hergé tales (The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham''s Treasure), with the ambiguities ironed out and the emphasis on the action as opposed to the comedy. It shows how the boy reporter (played here by Jamie Bell) plucks a model ship from a bric-a-brac stall and immediately finds himself targeted by all manner of gun-toting goons. The ship, it transpires, contains a rolled parchment that points the way to a long-lost stash of gold and jewels. Along the way, Tintin hooks up with Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), the turbulent, whisky-sozzled descendant of seafaring nobility, now kept as a virtual prisoner aboard his boat.</p><p>In one superbly executed sequence, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy the dog must steal into the cabin to pluck the keys from the hand of a sleeping sailor as the ship rolls and pitches in a heavy sea. Except that once inside, Haddock keeps groping for an elusive bottle of whisky and Snowy for the uneaten sandwich on the upper bunk. Only Tintin – as ever, an emblem of resolute virtue – has the presence of mind to go straight for the keys.</p><p>Yet while the big set pieces are often exuberantly handled, the human details are sorely wanting. How curious that Hergé achieved more expression with his use of ink-spot eyes and humble line drawings than a bank of computers and an army of animators were able to achieve. On this evidence, the film''s pioneering "performance capture" technique is still too crude and unrefined. In capturing the butterfly, it kills it too. What emerges is an array of characters (puffy, moribund Haddock; opaque, inexpressive Tintin) that may as well be pinned on to boards and protected by glass.</p><p>Viewed from a distance, The Adventures of Tintin stands proud as freewheeling, high-spirited entertainment. But those close-ups are painful, a twist of the knife. There on the screen we see Hergé''s old and cherished protagonists, raised like Lazarus and made to scamper anew. But the spark is gone, their eyes are dusty, and watching their antics is like partying with ghosts. Turn away; don''t meet their gaze. When we stare into the void, the void stares back at us.</p><p><em>In cinemas from 26 October</em></p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/culture&k=Tintin&k=Culture&k=Steven+Spielberg&k=Peter+Jackson&k=Film&k=UK+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/culture/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/culture/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+Adventures+of+Tintin%3A+The+secret+of+the+Unicorn+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1648458&ch=Culture&c2=60753&c4=Tintin++%28Culture%29%2CCulture%2CSteven+Spielberg+%28Film%29%2CPeter+Jackson+%28Film%29%2CFilm%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CComics+and+graphic+novels+%28Books+genre%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Xan+Brooks&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648458&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: culture/2011/oct/16/tintin-adventures-secret-of-unicorn|2011-10-16T21:13:38+01:00|96d27d4cf9687bc21dca92626318cac9362a839c -->', NULL, 'Culture', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:41'),

Commemorations are planned for the 50th anniversary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_massacre_of_1961" title="">French-Algerian massacre</a>, when up to 200 peaceful protesters were slaughtered in cold blood around iconic national monuments, including the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame Cathedral.</p><p>The most memorable – and vicious – atrocities saw policemen herding panicking crowds on to Paris''s bridges, where many were tossed into the Seine. Normally a romantic symbol of the most popular tourist city in the world, the river became a watery morgue for scores of victims, whose lifeless bodies were washing up for weeks afterwards.</p><p>Others died in police stations, or in nearby woods, where their mutilated bodies testified to truncheon and rifle-butt injuries. The officers had been incensed by an illegal protest by 30,000 men, women and children organised by the National Liberation Front (FLN) – the main Algerian nationalist group in their country''s war of independence with France.</p><p>Fifty years will seem like a long time to many of the young French Algerians who mark the anniversary today, but in many ways it seems very recent. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Papon" title="">Maurice Papon</a>, the Paris police chief who instigated the killings, only died four years ago, aged 96; and some of his unrepentant and unpunished henchmen still remain at large.</p><p>Like Papon, many of the killers had been Nazi collaborators who learned their crowd control methods from the Gestapo. They were experts at disinformation too: the official death toll after Papon''s self-proclaimed "Battle of Paris" was initially three, before being revised to a vague "several dozen" almost 40 years later.</p><p>No judicial inquiry ever took place, with many French still blaming Algerian in-fighting and terrorist attacks for the deaths. Papon was finally brought to justice for crimes against humanity – but only for those he committed during the second world war. President Charles de Gaulle, and then successive governments, ensured he was never indicted for what he did to the French Algerians of Paris.</p><p>Most now live in the blighted housing estates which dot the outskirts of the capital. These banlieues grew out of the immigrant worker shanty towns which became recruiting grounds for the FLN in the 50s and 60s. Police felt they could control "insurgents" better on the&nbsp;estates, and they are still&nbsp;overflowing with young people from north Africa.</p><p>As during the nationalist war, French Algerians are still encouraged to stay out of tourist Paris. Curfews are regularly imposed on the estates, with armoured vehicles filled with paramilitaries moving in during disturbances. When particularly heavy rioting broke out in 2005, the then interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, imposed a state of emergency. Like the curfews, it was based on Algerian war legislation from 1955.</p><p>Up to 40% of young French Algerians from the estates are currently unemployed. Without money or prospects, some have turned to crime, helping to swell a prison population <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/28/AR2008042802560.html" title="">estimated to be up to 70% Muslim</a>. Many resemble the angst-ridden, alienated young Algerians who took to&nbsp;the streets in 1961.</p><p>Statistics about the current generation are unofficial because secular France does not record the ethnicity and religion of its citizens, but there is no doubt that French Algerians still regularly experience what it is like to be a second-class citizen. Racism against France''s largest minority group is endemic – from the public and private institutions who fail to employ them, through to the media organisations which fail to report their issues.</p><p>Few would argue that the tribal murders committed by Paris police half a century ago are likely to be repeated today. But nor would anyone pretend that the discriminatory policies which gave rise to such horrors have disappeared from modern France.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=France&k=Europe&k=World+news&k=Maurice+Papon&k=Middle+East&k=War+crimes" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+massacre+that+Paris+denied+%7C+Nabila+Ramdani+Article+1648345&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=60753&c4=France%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CMaurice+Papon%2CMiddle+East+%28News%29%2CWar+crimes%2CLaw%2CAlgeria+%28News%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Nabila+Ramdani&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648345&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2011/oct/16/massacre-paris-denied|2011-10-16T21:13:38+01:00|8ed5a27f34f70e59fab4618f926a98157386006c -->', NULL, 'Comment is free', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:41'),

But a last-ditch breeding programme might just save this extraordinary-looking species', '<p>If prizes were awarded for the world''s unluckiest bird, the spoon-billed sandpiper would be a&nbsp;leading contender. It breeds along the coast of Chukotka province, in easternmost Russia, where snow, floods and predators may foil its short window of opportunity to raise a family.</p><p>If any chicks do survive, they must undertake one of the most perilous journeys of any migratory bird: 8,000km (5,000 miles) to their wintering grounds in Myanmar and Bangladesh. On the way they pass through the world''s industrial powerhouses – Japan, China and South Korea – where the reclamation of coastal wetlands for economic development is proceeding at a terrifying rate. To make matters worse, if the sandpipers do reach their wintering grounds, poor local communities trap them for food. It''s hardly surprising the spoon-billed sandpiper is heading for extinction.</p><p>Never common – the world population in the late 1970s was estimated at 2,400 breeding pairs – the species declined to&nbsp;1,000 pairs by 2000. Then the real nosedive began: it may now have dropped below 100 pairs, a fall of 90% in a single decade. Unless something can be done soon, extinction in the wild is virtually inevitable within 10 years. Hence the brave and controversial decision by the <a href="http://www.wwt.org.uk/" title="">Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust (WWT)</a>, along with conservation partners including the RSPB and Birds Russia, to take spoon-billed sandpiper chicks from the wild and raise them in&nbsp;captivity, at the trust''s HQ at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire.</p><p>Brave, because although captive breeding works well with large, long-lived species such as ducks, geese and cranes, it is much harder to achieve with a small, migratory wader. Controversial, because some argue that scarce resources would be better spent on preserving wetland habitats for species more likely to survive in the long term.</p><p>Yet this is no ordinary bird. At a distance, the spoon-billed sandpiper looks like any other small wader: plump, brown-and-white, with a hunched appearance. But close-up, it reveals the feature that gives the bird its name: the extraordinary spatula-shaped bill, unique among the world''s 200 or so species of wader.</p><p>The effort to save it is itself a story worthy of the Boy''s Own Paper. First, Nigel Jarrett, the WWT''s captive breeding expert, and his team had to get to the bird''s breeding grounds: a perilous helicopter flight into the sub-Arctic tundra. When they arrived, on 30 May, they found to their dismay that a thick layer of snow covered the nesting areas. A week later, a few pairs had arrived and taken up residence, but as the snow melted, their territories were flooded. By 19 June, the females had finally begun to lay, and in early July the team managed to collect 20 eggs, from which 17 chicks hatched.</p><p>After 72 hours without sleep, an exhausted Jarrett boarded a dinghy with his precious cargo – and as he did so, a pod of belugas and a single grey whale surfaced alongside and accompanied him to his rendezvous with a passing cruise ship. "Sitting there holding the chicks of one of the rarest species on the planet, while this huge creature rose above the waves and looked me straight in the eye, was one of the most awe-inspiring moments of&nbsp;my life," he says.</p><p>On 18 August, after two long flights across Siberia, the chicks reached Moscow zoo, where they had been waiting in quarantine until, last week, the remaining 14 chicks finally arrived at their new home at Slimbridge.</p><p>Now the real hard work begins. As well as rearing a captive population of spoon-billed sandpipers, the conservationists must also find ways of saving their last remaining breeding, stopover and wintering habitats from development, otherwise there will be nowhere to reintroduce the birds in the future. This is where Chukotka''s most famous adopted son comes in. As governor of this remote and deprived state until 2008, Roman Abramovich lavished some of his vast wealth to help its people. Helping its wildlife – in the shape of the spoon-billed sandpiper – would be another way of putting this extraordinary place on the map.</p><p>One thing is sure, if these efforts do not succeed, the bird will soon join the dodo, great auk and passenger pigeon in the roll of infamy; those once living, breathing creatures we have driven to oblivion. In the words of Deborah Pain, WWT''s director of conservation: "This tiny wader is a flagship species for millions of waterbirds that travel the same migratory route, and are equally threatened. If we fail, our descendants will inherit a vastly impoverished world. We simply can''t afford to lose any species – let alone one so special as&nbsp;the spoon-billed sandpiper."</p><p></p><p><em>Stephen Moss is a naturalist, writer and broadcaster.

They performed first, their VT consisted of nothing but Tulisa helplessly puffing out her cheeks and the judges couldn''t hide their hated of their performance. They literally couldn''t have done anything more to convince the public to vote them out without singing the theme-tune to Appropriate Adult. I''m positive that Nu Vibe will leave X Factor tonight, but then again I said that Sophie would go last week so there''s a very strong chance that I''m talking out of my flap here.</p><p>Since this is the Sunday results show, you know what to expect. There''ll be recaps, there''ll be a couple of performances - apparently from Katy Perry and The Wanted - and there''ll be more adverts than you could possibly know what to do with. Oh, and someone might get eliminated at the end if there''s time. Things kick off at 8pm; say hello in the comments and I''ll see you back here in a bit.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.42pm:</span> While we wait, is anybody else watching Holding Out For A Hero? I am, and I can''t for the life of me wonder why nobody else thought of reimagining Who Wants To Be A Millionaire for charity purposes and naming it after a hi-energy dance-pop hit from the Footloose soundtrack and getting the bloke of the Holland And Barratt adverts to host it. I mean <em>Jesus</em>, that''s <em>obvious</em> isn''t it?</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.54pm:</span> There''s a group song tonight, I hear. A real life group song where everyone tries to wail their single line louder and more tremulously than everyone else. I''m excited. I love the group songs. They sound like radioactive theremin meltdown.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class="timestamp">7.59pm:</span> IT''S TIME! TO PRESS! THE FAST-FORWARD BUTTON (IF YOU RECORDED THIS LAST NIGHT)!</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.03pm:</span> In keeping with liveblog tradition, let''s say hello to the judges:</p><p>LOUIS - Pulling a face like someone just told him a joke and he''s too polite to admit that he doesn''t get it.</p><p>KELLY ROWLAND - Sadly not putting anything down; a disappointment to those who wanted to see her euthanise a horse live onstage tonight.</p><p>TULISA CONTOSTAVLOS - Now her tattoo reads ''Sorry for dressing like an old lady''s toilet roll holder''. That tattoo speaks the truth, you know.</p><p>GARY BARLOW - Dreary Borednow, more like.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.08pm:</span> Here''s the group song. They''re singing that Hello song. Unless they''re miming it. Which they definitely are. But at least they''re all doing their little trademarks - Craig looks like he''s chewing a toffee, Sami''s shouting, Sophie''s wearing a nice dress but that''s all, Misha B and Anonymous Boyband Member did a bit of a rap, Frankie looks like he hasn''t washed for a month - so that''s something. It''s good to have you back, group song. And by ''good'', I mean ''I could physically feel the life draining from my body during it''.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.11pm:</span> And now we''re into the recap, just to remind you of last night''s events. In short, 12 people sang a song, about two of them weren''t insultingly bad, everyone watching aged a decade and then spent the next 24 hours fighting an inexplicable urge to eat some yoghurt. Hope this helps.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.14pm:</span> In the backstage bit of the recap, The Risk are demonstrating a worrying ability to repeat praise word for word. This''ll get much easier after about a month when, worn down by the group''s constant keychange stand-ups, the judges just groan a series of desperate vowels at them in the hope that they''ll stop.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.18pm:</span> Recap over, we''re straight into the first guest performance, by The Wanted - a group that appears to be made up of five humans and 20 neon lightbulbs. At this point it''s hard to say which has the most charisma.</p><p>Oh, I get it. The song''s called something like Playing With Lightning, and the lightbulbs are a bit like what lightning bolts would be like if they were small and rigid and made of glass and rooted to the ground. A real lightning bolt wouldn''t be seen dead on this stage. Not without taking out one of the bandmembers, at least. If I was a lightning bolt, I''d get the one who looks like he''s about three. </p><p>Incidentally, according to The Wanted, playing with lightning is ''a little bit frightening''. I imagine when writing the song it was a choice between ''a little bit frightening'' or ''a day trip to Brightin''. They probably picked the best option, to be honest.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.22pm:</span> Hang on, are these the first adverts of the show? It''s been going for 20 minutes, for crying out loud. I need adverts every six or seven minutes. I <em>need</em> them. How else am I supposed to know what to buy? Buy using a combination of word of mouth recommendations and common sense? Don''t be STUPID, ITV. I demand better.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.25pm:</span> Lines are now closed. You can no longer adopt a misinformed sense of superiority for rising above the capitalist machinations of reality television.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.26pm:</span> And now Katy Perry is giving an exclusive performance of her new single. And what''s this? A GUITAR? Lyrics that namecheck RADIOHEAD? This is disappointing. Whatever happened to her depressing faux-lesbianism? I''m sorry Katy, this simply won''t do?</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.27pm:</span> It''s OK. The disco beat will kick in any minute and she''ll start singing about boobs or whatever. She has to. She <em>has</em> to.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.28pm:</span> Hurry up Katy Perry. Kick it up a notch, because I''m starting to get an urge to throw a coin into your guitar case. Not a very large denomination of coin, obviously. I''m not an idiot.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.29pm:</span> Somewhere, Jack Johnson is watching this and wondering why his hair looks so rubbish when he has these out-of-body experiences.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.30pm:</span> Dermot just called Katy Perry''s performance ''brilliant''. But quietly, so that nobody would hear him. Nice try, Dermot. I''m on to you.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.35pm:</span> And now some more adverts. Relentless volume, disorientating lights and mindless repetition. See? Sony PlayStation is doing Katy Perry better than Katy Perry just did.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.37pm:</span> And we''re back. Don''t worry, everyone, we''re at the part of the show where stuff actually happens. By ''stuff'' I mean a series of pauses and drawn-out announcements that could feasibly be carried out over a period of about 15 seconds, but we should probably just take what we can from this.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.38pm:</span> The Risk are safe. Janet is safe. Kitty''s gone a funny colour.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.39pm:</span> Craig is safe. Johnny is safe. Frankie''s headlice have joined hands in a show of solidarity.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.40pm:</span> Misha B is safe. Sami is safe. Sophie looks in terrible danger of displaying an emotion.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.41pm:</span> Rhythmix are safe. Sophie is safe. Nu Vibe are reenacting that bit from Toy Story 3 where they all think they''re going to die.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.42pm:</span> Kitty is safe. Marcus is safe. It''s Frankie vs Nu Vibe. Nu Vibe go home. BYE EVERYONE!</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.42pm:</span> Oh fine, I''ll wait until the end. You people, honestly.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.43pm:</span> Of course, I''m imagining that Frankie is pinching his bumhole so tightly that all his tattoos are now internal. I don''t know why I decided to share that with you.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.48pm:</span> First to sing for their survival is Nu Vibe. And the song they hope will keep them in the competition? Promise This by Cheryl Cole. That''s great, because Cheryl Cole has had such a long and promising stint on X Fact... oh.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.50pm:</span> To be fair, this is the best that Nu Vibe have ever performed on X Factor. That''s largely because it doesn''t sound exactly like traffic death, but it''s still a step up. Frankie''s going to need to pull something special out of the bag to beat them. No, Frankie, don''t pull <em>that</em> out of the bag. NOT THAT. Oh, Frankie, you are a dirty bleeder.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.51pm:</span> Frankie''s survival song might not actually be a song. He''s just letting vowels tumble out of his mouth. It''s like trying to have a telephone conversation with a old drunk man in a pub. Only, you know, the drunk man''s wearing crap leggings.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.53pm:</span> Whatever this song is, Frankie''s saying "I can''t do this by myself" a lot. Either that''s the name of the song or he''s dedicating the performance to all the girls whose names are tattooed across his buttocks. I suspect it''s the latter.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.53pm:</span> Gary votes to send Nu Vibe home. Well, duh.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.54pm:</span> Kelly waits an actual age and then sends Nu Vibe home. It all rests with Louis Walsh. So it''ll be deadlock, then.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.56pm:</span> Louis sends Nu Vibe home. I don''t know what''s more surprising - the fact that I made an accurate prediction or the fact that Louis Walsh actually made a decision.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.57pm:</span> In the best bits package, Tulisa claimed that Nu Vibe were going to "blow people out the water". That''s what they''ll be doing on Monday, then, getting jobs as experimental lifeguards. On the plus side, Nu Vibe are now free to detest each other openly as nature intended.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><span class="timestamp">8.58pm:</span> So that''s the end of Nu Vibe, but don''t worry. They might be going home, but they''re going home as pioneers. After all, who else has appeared on X Factor, been consistently disappointing and then quietly slunk off home? What''s that? Almost everyone who''s ever appeared on X Factor? Oh, OK, I take it back, then.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and for all the typically wonderful comments. I trust you''ll all be back to join me next Saturday, when X Factor drops below the psychologically important two-hour mark for the first time.

So why does the Telegraph continue to deny the truth?', 'Charlie Brooker', 'http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/10/14/1318614271918/David-Cameron-is-a-lizard-003.jpg', '2011-10-16 22:00:00', NULL, '<strong>Charlie Brooker</strong>: Don''t just take my word for it. Ask all those who have seen the reptilian demon in action', '<p>Last week, during the opening preamble to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/09/charlie-brooker-bbc-cuts?INTCMP=SRCH" title="">a fairly pedestrian whinge</a> about glitzy BBC promo trails, I called Prime Minister David Cameron a "pitiless blank-eyed hell-wraith" and described his familiar evening ritual: a stomach-churning rite&nbsp;which opens with ceremonial skin-shedding and climaxes with the swallowing of a live foal.</p><p>So far, so utterly reasonable. But Graeme Archer of the Daily Telegraph was less than impressed. In a riposte entitled "Charlie Brooker and the Tragedy of the Modern Left", he wrote that he was appalled that "Mr. Brooker felt the need to spend four paragraphs to tell us that the Prime Minister is, in fact, a lizard [and] that he is served by lizards who aid him in the consumption of live flesh once the sun goes down."</p><p>He went on to criticise the article''s "quite repellent imagery, deliberately deployed in order to de-humanise a perfectly reasonable Conservative", before complaining that "to describe a political opponent as a blood-sucking lizard isn''t amusing; and even if it were, it is depraved". In conclusion, he wrote: "Neither good people who vote Tory, nor their honourable opponents who vote Labour, are less than human: they are just people who happen to disagree on political objectives and tactics."</p><p>Archer has a point. It isn''t fair to imply someone is "less than human". It would be unfair, for instance, to describe Geoff Hoon as "an overfed, self-satisfied cat, oozing smugness" or to describe Labour MPs en masse as a "legion of dead-eyed Brown spawn", as Archer did in his Conservative Home blog, presumably as part of some strange unconscious typing accident.</p><p>Archer writes vividly and from the heart and, if his byline photo is anything to go by, appears to be a perfectly reasonable man (specifically, Ross Kemp). He deserves the benefit of the doubt. But I fear in his rush to reprimand the "Modern Left", he has overlooked one key fact: David Cameron <em>is</em> a lizard.</p><p>Yes, David Cameron is a lizard. A&nbsp;lizard that devours live foals in its lair. And as far as Archer is concerned, it''s perfectly fine for this limbless, non-human, Cameron-reptile-beast-thing to squirm across the stone floor of its den merrily excreting the bones of its victims, yet I''m "depraved" simply for writing about it. This is the tragedy of the Modern Right. They''re idiots.</p><p>Well, let me spell it out: You cannot dehumanise a lizard. Not without humanising it first, by giving it a little top hat, say, or a monocle. Maybe put some lipstick on it. And a wig. Teach it to walk sexy. That''s the way. Now confess: you already feel like getting to&nbsp;base three with the thing. But don''t! It''s still just a creature.</p><p>But that''s a standard lizard we''re talking about. Sadly Cameron is no standard lizard. He can''t even be classified as a conventional reptile, because that would require him to have some kind of quantifiable earthly form – which, as a malevolent paranormal entity continually shifting between dimensions, he simply doesn''t have.</p><p>I know this sounds crazy. But don''t take my word for it. Last week I asked the online community if it had further proof of Cameron''s true nature. I was immediately inundated with terrifying eyewitness accounts.</p><p>Twitter enthusiast @djamesc wrote: "I went to school with Cameron. He used to curl up next to the radiator during lunch. He only ate once a week."</p><p>Steve Hogarty said: "I once saw him behind a branch of Waitrose using both hands to squeeze a swollen pulsating neck gland (or ''sac'') into a dustbin."</p><p>Pianist Stephen Frizzle "witnessed Cameron slice off his finger whilst preparing vegetables, and it just grew back. No word of a lie."</p><p>Rob Carmier from Brighton recalled that on the day the lift wasn''t working at the G8 summit, Cameron "merely climbed the glass exterior with flattened palms".</p><p>Gareth James explained the recent hot weather was caused when Cameron "surrounded the UK with glass walls because he needs to live in a vivarium".</p><p>While a few of Cameron''s lizard properties sound almost charming – as Betsy Martian pointed out: "if ever he&nbsp;thinks his backbenchers are conspiring against him, he can turn his head a full 180 degrees to check" – others are less attractive.</p><p>For instance Paul Yates recalled: "I went to a business lunch with Cameron once and he ordered spiders. We all laughed, but he just stared at us."</p><p>This chilling behaviour was merely the tip of a deeply unsettling iceberg. Pete Strover encountered "a pack of feral dogs gathered in an underpass" which "barked Cameron''s name in unison", Dave Probert "once saw Cameron vomit up his entire skeleton to avoid having to admit he doesn''t know where Wales is", Tom Bain "saw Cameron put his entire hand through the hole in the middle of a CD", while perhaps most damningly of all, Darren&nbsp;Smith said: "I heard he strips completely naked to have a shit."</p><p>Hundreds of similar reports flooded in. I did my best throughout the week to alert everyone on Twitter to Cameron''s reptilian ways, but after several hours of unrelenting lizard warnings from me, they grew bored. Some begged me to "be funny again". Others asked me to "drop the lizard shit" or "change the record" or "STFU". Undeterred, I bravely persisted, all week long, repeatedly tweeting that Cameron was a lizard. Or maybe two lizards. Or some sort of ghost. But definitely evil and definitely not human. Yet still, thousands unfollowed me. It&nbsp;was almost as if they simply didn''t want to be told that David Cameron is a reptilian daemon that enters our realm each morning by slithering through a haunted mirror in&nbsp;order to feast on human&nbsp;souls.</p><p>No one wants to know. They''re in denial, or maybe hypnotised by the&nbsp;sulphurous mind-control gas Cameron emits from a series of gummy, puckering apertures along his underbelly. At least here&nbsp;you get the truth. Which is that he is a lizard. And by "he", I mean Cameron. David Cameron. Who is a lizard. David Cameron is a lizard.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=David+Cameron" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Charlie+Brooker%3A+Everyone+knows+David+Cameron+is+a%26nbsp%3Blizard.+So+why+does+the+Telegraph+continue+to+deny+the+truth%3F+Article+1648078&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=60753&c4=David+Cameron&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Charlie+Brooker&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648078&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2011/oct/16/charlie-brooker-cameron-a-lizard|2011-10-16T21:13:40+01:00|6d4081772112e27f04190efb1effe6f658e30fad -->', NULL, 'Comment is free', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:43'),

The Care Quality Commission''s recent <a href="http://www.cqc.org.uk/" title="">findings</a> are, shockingly, no shock to anyone. As a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/oct/13/institutional-ageism-in-our-hospitals?newsfeed=true" title="">letter to the Guardian</a> the following day pointed out, these were exactly the findings of a report commissioned by the secretary of state for health in 1998. Thirteen years later, nothing has changed. Outraged reports accumulate on the shelf, gathering dust.</p><p>Extraordinary advances in medical technology continue, but we make painfully little progress – even some signs of deterioration – in something much cheaper, and surely much easier in healthcare: the quality of relationships. As the commission''s chair ruefully <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/oct/13/nhs-hospitals-care-of-elderly?newsfeed=true" title="">commented</a>, "kindness and compassion cost&nbsp;nothing".</p><p>Inevitably, the report prompted soul-searching in the days afterwards; many members of the public described very painful stories of the care their elderly parents received in their last years.</p><p>Joan Bakewell, interviewed on Radio 4''s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/today" title="">Today</a> programme, pondered the impact of the decline of religion, asking who now teaches kindness as she learned it in Sunday school.</p><p>It''s an interesting point, but sadly not one I suspect that stands up to scrutiny. Religious institutions have been revealed to have a patchy – and that is being charitable – record on kindness. No, I think there is something very important at stake here that is not about secularisation but about marketisation – how all our patterns of thought are now modelled on the transactions of the market.</p><p>"What do I get out of this relationship?" is now regarded as a perfectly legitimate question, as if relationships are simply a kind of investment portfolio. The language of trade, finance&nbsp;and commerce has infiltrated how we understand our lovers, our friends, our neighbours and those for whom we work. Social capital, social skills – this is using the language of the market to describe relationships and the values and the inspiration that sustain them.</p><p>Much of this marketisation has neatly reinforced individualism''s aspirations to freedom and autonomy. But there is a problem. It''s blindingly obvious and yet ignored: it doesn''t give a full account of human experience. There are large chunks of our lives when we are either being cared for or we are caring for others. Caring for others cannot be totted up according to a calculus of cost and returns.</p><p>Dependency – others on us or us on others – is a central part of life. It is not something to be ashamed of and avoided at all costs. Care cannot always be easily shoehorned into the gaps in a busy life of consuming and working. This is why ultimately this cultural pattern of marketisation is so cruel: it makes shameful what is an inescapable part of human experience. It denigrates and belittles the qualities needed to care, such as patience and gentleness. Worst of all, marketisation ensures that everyone arrives at the challenge of being a carer with an almighty shock, and often a sense of "Why did no one warn me?".</p><p>That''s what having children felt like for me. I felt I had been ambushed by something for which I was totally unprepared emotionally: the 24/7 dependence of a child and how that compromised all my aspirations to independence and achievement.</p><p>Now, it feels my age group is being ambushed again; we are all wondering and worrying about how one cares for elderly parents, how one deals with their dying and deaths. Their needs are often far more unpredictable than, but just as emotionally fraught as, the first experience of parenthood.</p><p>All of this hits women particularly hard because their socialisation for centuries has been bound up with expectations to care; only in the past few decades have some of those assumptions been unpicked.</p><p>But in their place, marketisation''s model of care is to buy it at the lowest possible cost. It says everything about our culture that caring is paid so badly and requires minimal training.</p><p>Compare how the two forms of care have been treated over the past 20 years: there has been a gradual and grudging reluctance to make the adjustments necessary to care for children (increased leave and part-time working), while the care of the elderly in an ageing society has been doggedly postponed – we simply don''t want to think about it.</p><p>Care for children fits into a marketised understanding of relationship: we talk of "investing" in our children. The state sees children as important because of their future worth to the economy as labour. But in this marketised mindset, the elderly have no economic value; they are perceived as a burden. The only values ascribed to the elderly are found – as recently celebrated in some <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/jun/26/grey-power-list-wrvs" title="">grey power list</a> – in silver-haired celebrities still working such as David Attenborough.</p><p>That''s a harsh form of exceptionalism in a culture of implicit contempt for the elderly''s frailty, dependence and intense vulnerability. What we have lost is the perception of the value of human experience beyond&nbsp;the busyness of the peak years of life; something captured by Milton in the final line of <a href="http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/Classic%20Poems/Milton/on_his_blindness.htm" title="">On His Blindness</a>, "they also&nbsp;serve who only stand and wait".</p><p>As the numbers of elderly increase and their last years are dominated by chronic ill health, their care will become ever more&nbsp;demanding in terms of resources and time. But tackling the policy implications is dependent on challenging these deeply ingrained cultural attitudes.</p><p>There is another set of reasons why we don''t find it easy to talk about the care of the elderly: many of them are in the final years of their lives. They are living very intimately with death. And that is the one big taboo of our age. We are the opposite of the Victorians: we are very open about our fascination with sex and very closed about death.</p><p></p><p>So, many of the elderly end up in hospitals – many with conditions for which there is no cure – and face only a protracted decline. A health system fixated on cure and prevention struggles inadequately with the process of dying, with the needs for kindness and comfort rather than for complex medical intervention, and with dying''s enormous repercussions for relationships. A fifth of all NHS beds are taken up by end-of-life care at huge cost, yet <a href="http://www.demos.co.uk/files/Dying_for_change_-_web_-_final_1_.pdf" title="">surveys</a> show that hospital is often the last place where the frail and dying want to be. It is also where people are often most dissatisfied: more than half of all complaints to the NHS are about end-of-life care.</p><p>What we have lost is any concept of honouring the elders, respect for their frailty, and recognition that supporting their final years before death is important for all of us – that death is a part of what makes all of our lives meaningful.</p><p>This is what Steve Jobs so bravely articulated in his remarkable <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/09/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-address?newsfee" title="">speech</a> to Stanford graduates in 2005 when he put death centre-stage. First, he referred to death as "useful", and then he went on to remind his audience about something that these young adults were probably reluctant to acknowledge on the day of graduation: that they would all age and die. It is the one universal human experience. And, finally, he claimed that death "is very likely the single best invention of life. It''s life''s change agent." Coming from an inventor fascinated by change, there could be no higher praise. It''s the kind of insight which challenges the cultural blindness which is crippling our capacity for compassion.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Older+people&k=NHS&k=Health&k=Healthcare+industry&k=Society&k=UK+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Our+market-shaped+way+of+life+has+no+time+for+the+elderly+or+the+art+of+caring+%7C+Madeleine+Bunting+Article+1648382&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=60753&c4=Older+people+%28Society%29+aged+elderly%2CNHS+%28Society%29%2CHealth+%28Society%29%2CHealthcare+industry+%28Business+sector%29%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CBusiness&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Madeleine+Bunting&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648382&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2011/oct/16/market-no-time-elderly-caring|2011-10-16T21:13:40+01:00|22c3f92da3a083ef267ebdca3bf9221cf1804156 -->', NULL, 'Comment is free', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:43'),

As we arrived both the hill behind us, known as Mynydd Mawr, and Bardsey Island opposite were topped with cloud. Flocks of chaffinches and skylarks sailed overhead veiled in grey, but we could track their westward passage by a downward drizzle of lark notes and the clear simple "spink" calls of the other birds. They are all autumn migrants, concentrated at this last terra firma by the Lleyn''s geography, and it was a pleasure to see them. Yet, in truth, we were more excited by the presence of another bird, whose magnetic pull to this same singular place is deeper and unchanging. It is called the red-billed chough, but the last explosive syllable is name enough, and a human echo of the glorious raw, high, resounding sounds of these crow-related birds.</p><p>Until the early modern period, choughs were found widely on most British coasts and upland areas, but the advance of arable farming triggered an inexorable retreat to the Celtic fringe. It is now largely a creature of western Wales and Ireland, of the Scottish isles and a few tors and cliffs in west Cornwall. Here, however, the choughs were in their element, planing through the soft light across the headland. They were also of their element. The birds may know nothing of the 580m-year-old rocks against which their plangent notes resound. They may know nothing even of their own habitat: that rare coastal heath, with its prostrate heathers and mats of gorse, interspersed with lawns of grass so springy they feel like deep-pile carpet. Yet the choughs are the genius loci of Uwchmynydd, while their curious voice, with all its wild, wind-flung resonances, is the signature music of this landscape.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/environment&k=Birds&k=Environment&k=Rural+affairs&k=Wales&k=UK+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/environment/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/environment/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Country+diary%3A+Uwchmynydd%2C+Gwynedd+Article+1648327&ch=Environment&c2=60753&c4=Birds+%28environment%29%2CEnvironment%2CRural+affairs%2CWales+%28News%29%2CUK+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Mark+Cocker&c7=11-Oct-16&c8=1648327&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: environment/2011/oct/16/country-diary-uwchmynydd-gwynedd|2011-10-16T21:13:40+01:00|8537072c230405e50a5c697ebe0f7ce96e8bda87 -->', NULL, 'Environment', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-16 22:13:43'),

When Jobs rejoined Apple in 1996, one of his first acts was to move all of the company''s data – including fiercely protected information about the business''s future plans – to Apple''s servers, rather than entrusting that valuable information to individual&nbsp;computers.</p><p>Flash forward to 2011 and Apple''s iCloud service is pushing the idea to customers that the cloud is an actual place where photos, documents, calendars and contacts can be stored. In fact there''s a unity of message from the three best-known names in technology, with Google also pushing the cloud through its five-year-old Google Docs offering, which lets users collaboratively edit documents from different devices, and Microsoft following up years of cloud talk with a serious commitment to pushing take-up of its cloud services.</p><p>While consumers might not need to understand how a Hotmail account is accessed through a smartphone, or why Facebook information is available on any device connected to the internet, the same delivery principle powers many of the most popular consumer web services. Many business solutions are also now delivered in the same way; however risky or radical it may once have seemed to store important company data on remote servers in the cloud.</p><p>The simple argument for businesses in favour of cloud computing is that buying expensive new servers is left to the cloud computing provider, which will also keep software updated and look after security.</p><p>Those are powerful plus points and cloud computing is now being considered in every corner of every business. For many startups, it''s their first resort: Twitter, Foursquare and dozens of others turned first to Amazon''s cloud computing service to store and process data because it meant they didn''t have to buy servers to store anything; they would just pay for the storage and bandwidth they used. That turns computing from a capital expense into an operating expense, with direct benefits for cashflow – key for a small business.</p><p>Andy Burton, chairman of the Cloud Industry Forum, an industry group, cites the case of LawWare, based in Edinburgh, which writes software for legal practices: it wanted to speed up implementation, and so turned to cloud providers so it could rapidly develop projects for customers. "The time taken to implement a new system went from weeks to hours," says Burton.</p><p>He says that the problem with the word "cloud" is that many people find it ambiguous: is it about flexibility, or speed, or cost? He argues that "it makes you a more competitive organisation" and that the key question to ask is which of those three is the most important to improve, and focus on how cloud systems can help.</p><p>In June 2009, just after Michael Jackson''s death, Twitter saw traffic peak at 456 tweets a second but, by August 2011, following news of Beyoncé''s pregnancy, it was generating 8,868 tweets a second. Flexible cloud-based servers meant that Twitter could handle that explosive growth – few companies could forecast&nbsp;and manage such expansion on internal&nbsp;systems.</p><p><strong>Essential characteristics</strong></p><p>But what is cloud computing? The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) formally defines cloud computing as "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources – networks, servers, storage, applications and services – that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."</p><p>There are five essential characteristics: on-demand self-service, so you decide how much power you need; broad network access, so it''s available across the network; "resource pooling", so you don''t care where the computers storing the data are; "rapid elasticity", so that computing power available can ramp up as demand grows; and measured service, so that you''re only charged for what you use – which might be storage, bandwidth, processing, user accounts, or some combination of those.</p><p>The idea that cloud services will make a big difference to businesses has been a recurrent theme of technology discussions for the past 10 years or so. Certainly, UK businesses have indicated that they are ready to adopt cloud computing. A study in the first half of 2011, which polled IT and business decision-makers across the private and public sectors, found that almost half already use cloud services. The private sector leads the way, with those employing more than 20 people ahead of smaller businesses in adoption (52% v 38%) – even though the latter could gain more because of the lower capital spending cloud computing requires. The driver for adoption is overwhelmingly cited as flexibility, with only 16% citing cost savings, though that figure rockets up to 69% among those already using cloud services.</p><p>In the public sector, the UK Police crime maps use a combination of Amazon and Google Maps, while <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/dec/14/underground-trains-live-maps-tfl-api" title="">Transport for London (TfL) is a high-profile user of Microsoft''s Azure platform</a>. TfL uses Azure to host its data feeds, which allows developers to create real-time travel information applications. Technology industry analysts Gartner says that by 2014 at least 10% of all businesses'' email services will be cloud-based and the tipping point to broad-scale adoption will have been reached.</p><p>It''s not just going to be about Hotmail any more. The cloud is coming, and the only question soon might be why your business isn''t on board.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/cloud-technology&k=Cloud+technology" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=A+bright+light+for+business+Article+1647901&ch=Cloud+technology&c2=60753&c4=MIC%3A+Cloud+technology+%28microsite%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=11-Oct-17&c8=1647901&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: cloud-technology/clud-computing-business-facebook-uk-economy|2011-10-17T00:28:08+01:00|ccdfee37ca048388d2cf07bfcbcf6629e5e77fd5 -->', NULL, 'Cloud technology', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-17 01:28:13'),

This move was given a significant boost when the late Steve Jobs, in what would be his last public appearance at the helm of Apple, unveiled the company''s plans to make content hosted and delivered over the internet mainstream through its iCloud service.</p><p>Analysts and investors hailed the move: the ability to access contacts, calendars, music, messages, photos and apps across any number of internet-connected devices marked a new era for the consumer experience of the cloud.</p><p>"We are demoting the PC and Mac to just be a device," Jobs said.

Although the video had been uploaded in Italy back in 2006, it had been processed by servers in the US and Ireland. No content had been hosted in Italy, but Google''s Italian office was enough to give the Italian courts jurisdiction.</p><p>For companies wanting to store data in the cloud there is a minefield of data protection laws to negotiate, so it is essential to know which country your data is physically stored in. "Most organisations don''t even know what data they have," says Tony Lock, programme director at IT services consultancy Freeform Dynamics. "They are unsure where all the data is and once they''ve found it they are unsure how to protect it."</p><p>The European Union''s Data Privacy Directive is crucial for UK firms. Created to facilitate the free movement of sensitive private information within Europe, it also makes it hard for data to be moved outside the region. Implemented across Europe but with local variations, the requirement for UK firms is to take "appropriate technical and organisational measures" to protect data. Italy goes further and sets out what those measures should be and Denmark requires internet transmission of such data to be encrypted.</p><p>But which laws apply, for example, to a British company storing data about UK customers via a contract with a US cloud provider whose servers are located in Poland? At the moment – all three. Within the EU, a company can be prosecuted if it has an established presence in the form of an office and staff, equipment it owns or operates or if it just makes use of a data centre or equipment in a European country.</p><p><strong>Access to emails</strong></p><p>Conversely, for any company headquartered in America, data stored by that company, whether in the United States or in Europe, is subject to the US government''s Patriot Act. Introduced after the 11 September terrorist attacks, it allows federal investigators wide-ranging access to emails, medical, financial and other&nbsp;records.</p><p>"The Patriot Act is probably the best thing the US ever did to act as a disincentive to other companies to use US data storage services," says Lock. "Whose laws apply? I don''t believe there have been any court cases fighting it out between European and American laws yet, but it wouldn''t surprise me if there were some legislative challenges coming up in the next few years that will make lawyers very happy and others very confused."</p><p>Nonetheless, many of the largest cloud providers used by British companies – Amazon, Salesforce, IBM – are headquartered in the US. Salesforce specialises in hosting customer relationship management systems, so its data centres contain vast amounts of private information and it has an array of British clients, including Boots and Standard Life.</p><p>In a paper produced by the School of Law at Queen Mary, University of London, a series of contracts used by 31 of the largest cloud providers were examined. The study showed that 15 of the contracts made no mention of where data would be located or how it would be protected in transit. The authors believe that a non-EU software provider, such as an email or social networking service using cookies or running a script on an EU resident''s computer, would amount to making use of equipment in an EU member state, triggering that state''s data protection law.</p><p>And because EU law is designed to keep its citizen''s data hard to export outside the region, a US company which had perhaps temporarily stored information about US customers in a British data centre might be required to obtain customers'' consent before moving it out of the EU again.</p><p>EU justice commissioner, Viviane Reding, intends to review protection of cloud-based data before the end of the year. She said in May: "Currently, data transfers outside the EU are allowed only to countries that ensure an adequate level of protection or if there is a standard contract between two companies on data safeguards. You may wonder how we are going to implement this rule, particularly in cloud computing that entails the continuous transfer of personal data to a big number of destinations."</p><p>Her answer, or at least part of it, is that Europe must develop its own cloud computing centres.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/cloud-technology&k=Cloud+technology" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=How+global+laws+protect+your+data+Article+1647932&ch=Cloud+technology&c2=60753&c4=MIC%3A+Cloud+technology+%28microsite%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Juliette+Garside&c7=11-Oct-17&c8=1647932&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: cloud-technology/global-laws-protect-your-data|2011-10-17T00:28:08+01:00|d35f74da889d3b0e80ddd2ff1c9a5def9862829c -->', NULL, 'Cloud technology', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-17 01:28:13'),

It also provides resources to store data. The services can in turn be scaled up and down to meet a customer''s variable operational needs, ensuring maximum cost efficiency.</p><p><strong>There are three primary cloud service delivery models:</strong></p><p><strong>Saas (software as a service)</strong></p><p>Software as a service refers to software or applications that are accessed over the internet (typically from a public cloud, multi-tenancy (or shared) environment). Unlike desktop applications, Saas apps require no installation as they connect via the internet. Microsoft Office 365 is a popular example.</p><p><strong>Iaas (infrastructure as a service)</strong></p><p>Infrastructure as a service delivers computing infrastructure – such as CPU, RAM, storage and processors as virtual servers, along with networking capabilities – to provide a hosted data centre on demand upon which businesses can run their applications. This is computing as a service, rather than businesses having to purchase and manage their own expensive infrastructure. As with most cloud services it can be scaled up and down and customers usually only pay for what they&nbsp;consume.</p><p><strong>Paas (platform as a service)</strong></p><p>Paas refers to the environment within which developers can build and launch new applications. Well known cloud platforms include Microsoft Azure and Amazon EC2 and Force.com.</p><p><strong>Typically organisations will use more than one cloud deployment type depending on their needs. The most common deployment types are:</strong></p><p><strong>Public cloud</strong></p><p>Public clouds are intended to be used by multiple parties at once and are designed to provide maximum value for money through a standardised and hi-scale&nbsp;approach. Many public clouds operate internationally for scale or geographic resilience, but this gives rise to some concerns for some businesses over where their data is being stored at any given time.</p><p><strong>Private cloud</strong></p><p>Private clouds are intended to be restricted to a single customer or trusted community. These are popular among organisations looking to access the benefits of cloud computing but retain higher control and flexibility of configuration compared with a public cloud. Private clouds can be run inside a company data centre or hosted by a third party. This is an ideal solution where data sovereignty is a key issue.</p><p><strong>Hybrid cloud</strong></p><p>A hybrid cloud, as the name infers, is a cloud capability that joins either on-premise infrastructure to private or public clouds, or clouds to each other, to provide a customer with a bespoke environment to meet their specific operational&nbsp;needs.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/cloud-technology&k=Cloud+technology" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Find+your+way+through+the+terms+of+the+cloud+Article+1647937&ch=Cloud+technology&c2=60753&c4=MIC%3A+Cloud+technology+%28microsite%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Josh+Halliday&c7=11-Oct-17&c8=1647937&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: cloud-technology/cloud-computing-terms-jargon-buster|2011-10-17T00:28:08+01:00|598a3c84f78b3895c62a4eb89dfd57c60e006d77 -->', NULL, 'Cloud technology', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-17 01:28:13'),

Some are in the UK in name only; many businesses including Amazon, which has led the charge for the cloud with its suite of self-serve systems, have chosen Ireland, with its attractive tax incentives, as their base of operations. But not all of them are looking from the outside in.</p><p>In fact, Britain''s cloud industry has never been more vibrant or exciting – with rapid progress at almost every level.</p><p>In terms of research, a great deal of work on developing new cloud technologies takes place in the UK, both in private labs and alongside public institutions. Companies such as IBM, Microsoft and HP are choosing to link up with academic institutions, often working in conjunction with universities such as Cambridge and Bristol. Florida-based cloud provider Citrix, meanwhile, has three major research centres set up across south and eastern England to develop its Opencloud service.</p><p>It is not just US giants that have made their move into Britain: European companies such as French firm Talend, suppliers of data management services in the cloud, have also targeted the UK.</p><p>But while the business of providing core cloud infrastructure is dominated by foreign companies, there is still plenty of homegrown talent making waves. British leaders such as London e-commerce provider Venda has a list of clients which include Tesco and Universal Music. The business has proved so successful that it has expanded beyond the UK with offices in New York and Bangkok.</p><p>For some, buying British is not simply a case of supporting local businesses. Given that the whole point of the cloud is to outsource your IT infrastructure, going local might sound counter-intuitive. But in fact it can be massively important. If your data is stored by British companies in British data centres, there are fewer concerns about regulation and compliance. Buy British and companies can be sure, for example, that their information will not be subject to laws in different&nbsp;jurisdictions.</p><p>The biggest local innovations, however, appear to be happening at service level. Large British software companies such as Sage have launched cloud products, and a network of suppliers such as Stockton''s Onyx, which specialises in systems, applications and products in the cloud, have also emerged.</p><p>In fact, the number of businesses selling software as a service has grown so rapidly that they are now forced to look for new ways to stand out from the crowd. Stephen Holford is marketing director of cloud service provider Rise, Microsoft''s global hosting partner of 2011, and says: "The cloud is more about business transformation than technology. It is challenging the traditional IT supply chain to the extent that customers are evolving a hybrid model combining on-premise and cloud capabilities to meet their own unique needs."</p><p>Among those taking a more individual approach is Manchester-based Outsourcery, which specialises in providing cloud services and unified communications. The company has chosen to focus on its green credentials: data centres are well known as power-hungry places – Google, for example, recently made headlines by revealing that its worldwide network of server farms had an energy footprint of 260 megawatts, the equivalent of a sizeable coal-fired power plant. To help customers who take their environmental responsibilities seriously, Outsourcery offsets much of its carbon emissions.</p><p>But while the UK has plenty of activity, the shape of the market is still a long way from being straightforward. The adoption of the cloud is unevenly distributed, and many businesses have yet to understand the benefits that it can bring to them.</p><p>For example, a survey conducted by VMware earlier this year suggested that only 48% of small and medium-sized British companies had started using some form of cloud computing – compared with an average of 60% across Europe.</p><h2>Falling behind</h2><p>Some suggest that this could be turned around with better support from the top. The British government, one of the country''s most voracious IT consumers, has said it will switch many of its internal services to the cloud – but development of the so-called "G-Cloud" has been criticised in some quarters.</p><p>According to Salesforce boss Marc Benioff, one of the most enthusiastic advocates for cloud services over the past few years, Downing Street should be making more of an effort to use public cloud infrastructure, rather than its current position of trying to build its own solution.</p><p>"The UK government needs to get aggressive about cloud services," said Beniroff at a recent conference in London. "The UK is way behind in this."</p><p>Salesforce is not exactly a disinterested party: it is due to open its first data centre in Britain next year, and has plenty of products that it would dearly love to sell to the coalition government. But Benioff''s words are also a challenge to the rest of Britain''s cloud industry: perhaps it''s time to step up and make the most of the innovation that is already here.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/cloud-technology&k=Cloud+technology" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Best+of+British+Article+1647944&ch=Cloud+technology&c2=60753&c4=MIC%3A+Cloud+technology+%28microsite%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Bobbie+Johnson&c7=11-Oct-17&c8=1647944&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: cloud-technology/cloud-technology-best-of-british|2011-10-17T00:28:12+01:00|f3dee39964d9ec20045fe61c95d517758e52b177 -->', NULL, 'Cloud technology', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-17 01:28:15'),

Being able to offload storage of the growing mountain of corporate data to a third party, while making it accessible from any location on any device with an internet connection, has huge advantages for a business. It is also a huge temptation for hackers.</p><p>It has been a busy year for Lulz Security and other hacking co-operatives, with big, high-profile targets compromised. Sega and Sony''s gaming networks have fallen prey, as has Apple''s iTunes service. The most audacious target was RSA, a security firm which produces code-generating fobs used by 40m businesses to protect their own networks.</p><p>In fact, in most of the well-publicised cases, the servers attacked were managed by their owners and not by a cloud host. Where it played a role, the cloud tended to be used by the hackers against their target companies.</p><p><strong>Releasing data</strong></p><p>At RSA the unidentified hacker transferred sensitive information off company servers on to a hacked cloud-hosted server. Amazon, one of the leading renters of cloud storage, is reported to have unwittingly provided a server used in the Sony attack, although the company has never confirmed this. A hacker used a bogus name to set up an account for the raid on Sony''s PlayStation network during which the login names, passwords and other personal details of 77 million users were compromised.</p><p>Given such publicity, IT managers are understandably worried about releasing their data on to other firm''s servers. A global survey published earlier this year by Trend Micro of 1,200 IT executives (at companies with more than 500 employees) found that just 10% were currently using cloud services. Of these, 43% had experienced a data security lapse or issue with their cloud provider in the past 12&nbsp;months.</p><p>"Security is something which should be pushed more and more to the fore," says Simon Bain, whose company Simplexo supplies secure remote access to emails and documents.</p><p>Simplexo''s system stores emails and documents. Customers on the move can retrieve them by typing a keyword into a search box and Simplexo will search the files to find the relevant information.</p><p>It does index file content in order to do this, but the index is written in code. Simplexo does not store usernames and passwords either, if a customer loses them they are simply obliged to re-register. If the system is hacked, each individual''s information is "sand boxed" or stored separately.</p><p>Other companies, such as Telehouse, which runs 41 data centres around the world, maintain security by using a combination of firewalls and intrusion detection software.</p><p>The detection software Telehouse uses seeks out unusual patterns from a network, finding repetitive or continuous communication. It can also detect unusually heavy traffic. If the bandwidth being used on a particular interface goes above, say, 95%, a warning is triggered, which alerts human monitors.</p><p>Telehouse systems integration manager, Paul Kanabahita, says: "If a customer has a problem, we can know well before they do what the problem is."</p><p>Steve Hughes, senior cloud expert at telecoms and networks firm Colt Group, says IT mangers should seek out cloud providers with ISO (International Standards Organisation) accreditation. The standards require providers to vet their staff and have secure access to their server farms – no entry without a pin and a card.</p><p>He says protecting traffic in transit can be important for some customers. Encryption can be used for significantly more expense – private networks built where no other companies use the fibre optic cable carrying your data between particular servers.</p><p>Colt runs private connections between 25 European stock exchanges, including London''s main exchange, and banks and hedge funds trading on them. The networks are not only secure, they allow information to be sent and received more quickly, shaving valuable fractions of seconds off the time it takes to make a trade.</p><p>"You provide the appropriate risk profile for the appropriate application," says Hughes. "It''s not one cloud fits all."</p><p>Colt runs pairs of data centres in 10 European countries, so that if one goes down or is under attack genuine traffic can be transferred to the other without leaving the country. Because European data protection rules vary by nation, keeping information from crossing borders can be important for companies handling sensitive personal information.</p><p>For many firms, just working out what is being stored and where is a challenge. Chris Russell, vice president of engineering at Swivel Secure, says it is important to keep track: "The first thing to remember is even if you are pushing your data out to another party to look after, the responsibility for protecting that data stays with you."</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/cloud-technology&k=Cloud+technology" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Is+the+game+up+for+hackers%3F+Article+1647963&ch=Cloud+technology&c2=60753&c4=MIC%3A+Cloud+technology+%28microsite%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Juliette+Garside&c7=11-Oct-17&c8=1647963&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: cloud-technology/is-the-game-up-for-hackers|2011-10-17T00:28:12+01:00|0242ab64cc940bdc4a39e5a4c716c85e4097e1ef -->', NULL, 'Cloud technology', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-17 01:28:15');

He sees cloud as becoming universal. "We are moving from a world of you and I online to everything online," he says. Machines already exchange a lot more information than human beings do on this planet and this will continue to increase, he adds. "We''re talking about all vehicles, all items you purchase, being part of the cloud."</p><p>This means the ability to record locations of materials but also the use of sensors, he says. "An example would be nanosensors which are more sensitive than a dog''s nose, which can detect a single molecule of a substance." Attached to a cloud full of knowledge about what a particular substance could do, the applications for diagnostics and other scientific applications are myriad. Sensors with their data in the cloud could also handle things such as payments, he adds – in Korea, for example, when a bank issues a credit card they ask the customer if they want plastic or just the data loaded on to their phone. A sensor will detect the phone and handle the rest and record their transactions into a cloud system.</p><p>Business users will find their use of the cloud changes dramatically. A report from IT consultants Xantus, entitled <a href="http://www.xantus.co.uk/Insights-and-Research/A-Clearer-Horizon-Do-CIOs-have-more-clarity-about-cloud-computing.aspx" title="">A Clearer Horizon? Do CIOs have More Clarity About Cloud Computing?</a> suggests 98% of chief information officers have investigated cloud services, a quarter are using them already and that will rise to 73% within two years. That said, 86% say the term is being used to sell them goods and services without any real definition of what it means other than "please sign this requisition order".</p><p>Cloud might grow at different paces in different niches: Leslie Ferry, vice president of marketing at voice over IP communication specialists BroadSoft, sees it very much as something to be adopted by the communications industry. "Enterprises want to move rapidly beyond offering just voice communications to include other unified communications services such as video calling and conferencing, web collaboration tools and enterprise instant messaging," she says. "And the most efficient way to deploy and manage these new communication options across a dispersed workforce is through cloud-based services."</p><p>Reality will bite, however. The strength of the cloud is that it is multinational, of course; this has its drawbacks too. Steve Durbin, global vice president of independent body the Information Security Forum, says there is work to be done. "Every country has a different legal framework – especially around information, privacy and IT-based crime," he says. "Suppliers of services need to be able to reconcile conflicting requirements – in people, process, technology and law or regulation at both a local and global level." John Soanes, head of architecture at technology company Adapt, adds that cloud services don''t sit well with all software licences as they stand at the moment.</p><h2>Available bandwidth</h2><p>There are simpler practicalities, too. Terry Walby, UK managing director of cloud provider IPsoft, finds that when people take on cloud services they assume it''s going to manage itself. "It''s shocking to see how management has been forgotten within cloud solutions," he says. "Businesses could spend thousands of pounds or waste hundreds of man hours if they deploy cloud solutions without considering management." Cochrane is concerned not only about the management of bandwidth but the sheer amount of bandwidth available in the UK; it''s not enough, he says, and places like Korea are going to overtake us very rapidly.</p><p>There''s no doubt that cloud could transform the world and make life a great deal easier for many people. The only issue is that the pipework that underpins it – particularly in the UK – has to be up to the challenge.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/cloud-technology&k=Cloud+technology" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/cloud-technology/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=A+future+driven+by+data+Article+1647971&ch=Cloud+technology&c2=60753&c4=MIC%3A+Cloud+technology+%28microsite%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Guy+Clapperton&c7=11-Oct-17&c8=1647971&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: cloud-technology/cloud-technology-a-future-driven-by-data|2011-10-17T00:28:12+01:00|97dde3e79f2d412c205ec9f86ed772e583003ac9 -->', NULL, 'Cloud technology', 'guardian.co.uk', NULL, '2011-10-17 01:28:15'),

"British government IT is too expensive. At £21bn the annual cost dwarfes some government departments. It is three times the amount we spend on the army, more than the Department for Transport," he wrote one year ago as one of seven co-authors of the uncompromising document <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B3rcaHmLSeHBMDE1MTIzN2QtMjVhMy00YWRjLTgzODQtMDc2MmExNjBiMTQ5&amp;hl=en_US" title="">Better for Less</a> for thinktank the Network for the Post-Bureaucratic Age. "Across the country," the report continued, "schools are going to have to look for savings while central government IT programmes continue to burn staggering amounts of money." It costs up to £1,600 a year to run a desktop computer in central government, the report also pointed out, so there are potential savings of at least £2bn just by bringing that cost down to the £345 typical in local government.</p><p>Putting government applications and services in the cloud is central to achieving those savings. The previous Labour administration proposed the G-Cloud – a government-only cloud computing service – that would save £3.2bn out of a central budget of £16bn. Maxwell''s team suggested that by using commercial services from Microsoft, Google or Amazon, or one of the burgeoning number of private British cloud providers, serious amounts of money could be saved without the hassle of specifying anything beyond functionality.</p><p>The G-Cloud idea would see the government running the data centres, consolidating hundreds of centres currently being run around the country by central government, police, local authorities and other public sector institutions. The security services'', meanwhile, would remain separate.</p><p>Outlining the idea in January 2010, John Suffolk, then the government''s chief information officer, pointed out that 80% of government desktop machines could be supplied through a shared utility service. Powered by the cloud, Suffolk also suggested that government departments could share program code, creating an open source community inside government. Early estimates suggested that it could save £900m in the first five years, and £300m annually after that.</p><p>Research company TechMarketView, however,  suggests that the G-Cloud project is growing fuzzier at the edges: "The measurements for success have altered. Whereas previous talk was of reducing the number of data centres (from 200-plus to about 10), the current strategy is to reduce the cost of data centres by 35% over the next five &nbsp;years."</p><p>The Efficiency and Reform Group inside the Cabinet Office – of which Maxwell became the new advisor in September – hopes to get the project back on track by focusing on what''s important and affordable rather than "big bang" changes. But it needs to move quickly, TechMarketView says: "The pace … needs to pick up; not least because otherwise ICT market changes will outpace its progress … the UK government will only benefit from advances in technology if it can adapt its systems, processes and procedures quickly enough to cope with a new way of working."</p><p>A recent Public Administration Select Committee report  into government IT recommended changes, but the Cloud Industry Forum''s Andy Burton says: "Current procurement and governance practices struggle to handle ICT as a service rather than as a product. Cloud computing fundamentally enables and supports integrated cross-government procurement of ICT platforms while the pay-as-you-use approach allows for a far more flexible, innovative and competitive market for applications to meet public sector needs."</p><p>The G-Cloud project is now led by the MoJ chief information officer, Andy Nelson, and though it is still moving ahead, it is doing so cautiously. "There has been a change of emphasis away from ''the cloud'' being about new technologies, to being about the commercial model," TechMarketView''s analysts found. "When the cloud computing strategy is published later this year, we can expect it to explain what cloud computing means to UK government and how it will be structured, governed and&nbsp;implemented."</p><p>Hurry up and wait might seem like the constant refrain in government. But deep within Whitehall, change is happening.</p><h2>Government IT</h2><p>Busting budgets</p><p>The UK government is thought to have more than 200 data centres – nobody is quite sure how many.

It is critical that hospitals have the right numbers of specialist nurses, who can provide one-to-one care to premature babies and support for families at an extremely stressful time in their lives. Equally, a properly funded strategy is now urgently needed to recruit and retain more of these specialist nurses."</p><p>The shadow health minister, Diane Abbott, said David Cameron had failed in his promise to protect health service spending and had reneged on a pledge to recruit 3,000 new midwives. "Instead, we find our sickest newborn babies being put at risk by cuts in specialist nurses up and down the country," she said. "This is a clear betrayal of the promises that Cameron made to the British public."</p><p>She said frontline nursing staff needed to be "protected and supported as a matter of absolute priority".</p><p>The health minister, Anne Milton, said: "Our modernisation plans will cut the costs of administration by one-third over this parliament, and every penny will be reinvested into frontline services to improve quality for patients.</p><p>"We want to make sure that sick and premature babies get consistently high-quality neonatal care.

One mine spent £70,000 from its own funds during the rescue operation and a month later has not been compensated.</p><p>Police officers who were involved in the rescue expressed surprise and concern that there is no central fund to draw on with rescuers instead having to rely on the goodwill of others to pay for such operations as they unfold.</p><p><a href="http://www.peterhain.org" title="">Peter Hain</a>, the shadow Welsh secretary and MP for Neath, said that while the bravery of those taking part in the operation was not in doubt, the funding for it had been chaotic.</p><p>He said the Gleision tragedy highlighted a "potentially lethal flaw" in the way mine rescues are organised and funded.</p><p>Hain submitted a report on Monday to the government on issues raised by the events in the Swansea valley and is calling for a fundamental change to the way mining accidents are dealt with.</p><p>"Otherwise, should there be another tragedy, both the rescue and investigation could be badly compromised," Hain said in his report. "Only goodwill prevented that happening at Gleision."</p><p>Since the privatisation of the coal industry the responsibility for rescue operations has been taken on by a limited company called <a href="http://www.minesrescue.com/" title="">Mines Rescue Service (MSRL)</a>. It is approved by the government but is not funded by it.</p><p>Instead MSRL receives a levy from mines of 18p for each tonne of coal produced and supplements its income by providing training to private companies and public sector organisations.</p><p>But unlike most other emergency services it does not have access to additional funds when it suddenly needs to pay for extra equipment.</p><p>In his report Hain said that on the first day of the rescue, when there was optimism the men were still alive, there was a scramble to work out who was going to pay for pumps and the diesel to drive them.</p><p>Two nearby mines, Aberpergwm, which is owned by American company Walter Energy, and Unity Mine, agreed to help. Hain said the rescue effort was "effectively being funded from the internal budgets of Walter and Unity".</p><p>After the last of the men''s bodies was found at 4pm on Friday 16 September, the operation morphed into an investigation, and South Wales police will pay for this part of the effort.</p><p>A senior police officer involved in the operation also told the Guardian of his surprise when he learned there is no central fund to make sure vital equipment, such as pumps, is available and working.</p><p>Chief Superintendent Mark Mathias, said he was "taken aback" that there had been no central fund to draw on. "I didn''t know it was an issue," he said. "It is a debate that should be had."</p><p>Rhidian Davies, managing director of Aberpergwm Colliery, said there was never any doubt that it would provide men to help with the rescue and the resources to fund it, but it was a scandal that it had to do so. "It''s shocking. We''ve been saying for years there needs to be a central fund but it falls on deaf ears."</p><p>Accidents following the Gleision tragedy have continued to focus attention on the industry. Last month a man was killed in a roof fall at a colliery in North Yorkshire and on Friday a man had to be rescued from Unity Mine back in south Wales.</p><p>In his report, Hain says those involved in the Gleision tragedy, including MRSL, "performed heroically".</p><p>But he adds: "That should not detract from the very serious flaws Gleision has revealed. These must be urgently addressed by the government.

The Socialist Party''s eternal backroom boy, doing all the essential, worthy jobs, but keeping resolutely out of the spotlight.</p><p>François Hollande''s reputation as the perpetual man behind the scenes seemed chiselled in stone, when five years ago Ségolène Royal, pictured right, his partner and mother to his four children, was chosen by party members to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy for the keys to the Elsyée.</p><p>She lost. He resigned as party chairman. The couple split. It was assumed she might have another go at the presidency, but equally assumed that the good-natured ever-smiling Hollande would carry on in the shadows.</p><p>Then Hollande smartened up his act and dusted off his ambition. Out went the crumpled suits and the old-fashioned horn-rimmed spectacles, the extra kilos and the middle-age spread.</p><p>Out, some said, went his much-loved sense of humour and bonhomie, but the Socialists could not have everything. For in came a leaner, meaner, more serious Hollande; a man who could be – and if Sarkozy''s disastrous ratings continue will be – president.</p><p>The left''s Monsieur Ordinary will now be called upon to demonstrate extraordinary leadership skills: first to reunite his party, then, in a more problematic and pressing task, to reunite the fractious French left, before launching his presidential campaign.</p><p>He is in a strong position. Successive polls show the French are fed up with Sarkozy after only one term and ready, after 17 years of rightwing presidencies, for a change. A recent poll found 48% of French people believed Hollande could solve the country''s economic and financial crisis, compared with 28% for Sarkozy – results that are even more remarkable given that Hollande has never held a government position.</p><p>The 57-year-old, who is on the right of the Socialist Party, has always held the right cards to lead France. He studied at the prestigious Institute for Political Studies (Sciences-Po) and then the even more elite École Nationale d''Administration, the hothouse for French civil servants and politicians.</p><p>At ENA he met Royal, but he always appeared to be in his glamorous wife''s shadow as she was first appointed to a government post under Socialist president François Mitterrand, then made head of a regional council and then nominated presidential candidate. At one point the French nicknamed him Monsieur Royal.</p><p>Hollande held the essential, but dull jobs: as a trained lawyer, he sat on the French audit court and was office manager to a former prime minister''s press secretary. He served a town council, became a member of parliament, a university lecturer and Socialist Party secretary on economic issues.</p><p>In 2002 when a political earthquake saw the Socialist''s presidential hope Lionel Jospin knocked out by the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, Hollande, then party general secretary, was seen as an uncontroversial, soothing, and safe pair of hands – just what was needed to nurse the wounded and limping party back to health. Even so, few took him seriously.</p><p>In 2008 he stood down to make way for a leadership battle between Royal and Martine Aubry, which Aubry won.</p><p>Had it not been for the Dominique Strauss-Kahn scandal, Hollande would probably never have emerged from semi-obscurity. Strauss-Kahn was the favourite to win – convincingly – the party''s presidential nomination until his arrest in New York in May on charges of the attempted rape of a hotel maid. The charges were later dropped, but. Strauss-Kahn returned to France with his reputation and political dreams in tatters.</p><p>Now the presidential race begins, and it promises to be an interesting one, pitting two men with very different personal and political styles against each other. The phrase chalk and cheese springs to mind, or as the French say <em>jour et nuit</em> – day and night.</p><p>While Sarkozy''s edginess and ego are legendary, Hollande appears grounded and relentlessly cheerful. Sarkozy is charismatic and bling-bling; all flashy watches, Aviator sunglasses and supermodel wife. Hollande is down-to-earth, often self-deprecating, deeply private and lives with a Paris Match journalist.</p><p>While Sarkozy is acutely conscious of his height, to the point of avoiding being photographed with taller people during visits, Hollande – just three centimetres above Sarkozy – laughs about his size, saying it makes him difficult to knock over because of his low centre of gravity.</p><p>The more that observers analyse the life and career of Hollande, the more Mr Normal he seems. And that may be just what France needs.</p><div class="gu_advert">\n        <iframe marginheight="0" frameborder="0" width="300px" height="250px" style="border: none" src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=France&k=French+elections+2012&k=Nicolas+Sarkozy&k=Europe&k=World+news" marginwidth="0" scrolling="NO">\n          <a href="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom" rel="nofollow">\n              <img src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom" alt="Ads by The Guardian"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src=''http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Fran%C3%A7ois+Hollande+nomination+marks+the+triumph+of+Monsieur+Ordinary+Article+1648490&ch=World+news&c2=60753&c4=France%2CFrench+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CNicolas+Sarkozy+%28News%29%2CEurope%2CWorld+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Kim+Willsher&c7=11-Oct-17&c8=1648490&c9=Article'' width=''1'' height=''1'' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2011/oct/17/francois-hollande-monsieur-ordinary-profile|2011-10-17T00:28:14+01:00|4b21348c7996488718bec614891d9a79b9b28460 -->', NULL, 'World news', 'The Guardian', NULL, '2011-10-17 04:11:04'),

Upheaval in the economy is creating discontent at all levels. And for those of us leading the public sector we''re feeling it most acutely. If by some miracle you have some job security many of your friends and colleagues will have lost theirs.</p><p>Beyond job losses we''re all facing a barrage of discontent internally and externally. Internally, as we face the challenge of supporting colleagues adapt to new roles, pay deals and priorities, many of which they do not like or accept. Externally, unease is all too obvious from the August riots and their aftermath, to the subtler but no less passionate and visible campaigns to save services and stop the cuts.</p><p>What makes all of this especially difficult to stomach is that many of us never agreed to the changes that are fuelling the anger. And even if we did agree with some of them, we rarely supported its handling. So we''re left trying to hold together our organisations and communities when we would never have allowed this to happen in the first place.</p><p>Overly positivistic management gurus talk about clearing out "dead wood" or creating the space for essential "disruptive innovation". But we and our colleagues are human and humans find change hard. We just do. It creates anxiety and makes many of us angry. And with the double dip looming things are going to get angrier before they get calmer.</p><p>So what to do? In these angry times how do we make sure that our organisations, communities and lives don''t get derailed by a society at boiling point? Here are six steps that might just help you navigate the anger around you:</p><h2>1 Face the music</h2><p>It''s vital that leaders acknowledge the existence of any anger, conflict and uncertainty. We''ve all been in organisations when the boss has failed to do this through ignorance, incompetence or cowardice. Don''t be one of those. You don''t need to agree with whatever you''re acknowledging but if people feel that at least their concerns are acknowledged it is the vital starting point. This is relevant when working with the public as well. When communities raise concerns about service changes, recognise those concerns, regardless of whether you think their concerns are well founded. That is not the point.</p><h2>2 Communicate authentically</h2><p>When facing the angry music, explain it as you see it. Be as authentic as you can. Avoid management jargon at all costs – it will just serve to alienate you further. Don''t talk about "capacity overhead streamlining", talk about "friends and colleagues who have gone and will be badly missed".  Always acknowledge that your view is necessarily partial. Use subjective language to make this clear: ''In my opinion…" not "…this is a fact". If you can, explain the personal challenges you are facing, with a view to building common ground between them and you.</p><h2>3 Create clarity </h2><p>If a sense of injustice is often the spark for civic unrest, uncertainty is the fuel that maintains it. Outline very clear next steps even if those steps are creating a plan as opposed to having one. What people need is a concrete sense that whoever is in charge is in charge and knows what they are doing. Even if they don''t like what''s being proposed, a proposal is often better than no proposal. If a library''s being closed, for example, make it clear which library services are being maintained and how. What are your plans for the premises? What will you do with the books? Make all this as explicit as possible especially to the staff (first) and users (second).</p><h2>4 Establish shared goals</h2><p>Anxiety and anger can create doubt around people''s intentions. Wherever possible identify common goals. These could be high-level, such as improving the community and protecting the vulnerable, goals which people on all sides would agree with. Having established these, the next step is working out how to achieve them. Taking the library example: if there are areas for negotiation such as where library books will be located, whether to move some services online, or selecting which premises are to close, create space to discuss and agree these decisions with staff and community members. This could be through community workshops or online debates involving the public and press. This way not only can you channel public anger usefully, you can also harness the expertise you may otherwise miss.</p><h2>5 Empower others</h2><p>Anger is a powerful force that is at the heart of many effective organisations and projects. Do whatever you can to channel that anger into something meaningful. This may include giving other people the responsibility and support to solve the problems they now face. There''s nothing more frustrating than feeling a sense of injustice and not being able to do anything about it. Conversely, there are few things more empowering than a sense of injustice and the explicit mandate and support to do something about it.</p><p>Try giving colleagues or the community channels through which to "save" their services or jobs. In 2010 Lincolnshire council faced considerable public opposition to closing some of its museums and galleries. In response, the council gave the community the chance to put forward business plans to keep the facilities open. It was more of a platitude than a considered policy, but to the council''s surprise the community came back with some viable options that have led to many of the facilities being saved. The council is still providing some finance but a fraction of what it once did.</p><h2>6 Keep talking </h2><p>Angry and uncertain conditions make things change in unpredictable ways. This means you''ll want to keep talking to others to understand how their frustrations change and develop new plans with them in response. It will also be vital to ensure that uncertainty doesn''t raise its ugly face again. This is easy to say but challenging to do in the often hectic and reactive environments we now find ourselves. Try a mix of approaches – Facebook, Twitter and Youtube as well as more traditional community meetings. Different people like different ways of "talking". Be vigilant, assume you''re not communicating enough and continually check your assumptions with others.</p><p>Despite the malaise many of us feel that if handled well the tough times we now face may be fruitful. They are forcing many of us to reflect in ways we otherwise wouldn''t have. We all know tales of how the darkest nights have laid the foundations for the brightest days. And as we''ve seen, if handled properly anger can and often is a powerful force for good.</p><p>But that shouldn''t dissuade us from acknowledging that in those dark moments life is hard. That''s why we get mad  in the first place. So let''s not "keep calm and carry on", but get mad and motivated and try to make a difference to the mess we''re in.</p><p><em>Richard Wilson is director of Wilsonielsen, @richardwi1son</em></p><p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional" title=""><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.
